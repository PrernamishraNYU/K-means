      "['Aviation Authorities Ground Airline Over Safety Concerns  In an unprecedented move in local commercial aviation  history, the government decided to suspend the operations of a Colombian airline  because it believes that the airline does not meet aviation standards and  guarantee safety.  In fact, the Civil Aeronautics Administrative Directorate  notified AeroRepublica  airlines (currently ranked third in the country) that starting today it cannot  fly any of the nine DC-9 jets that make up its fleet.  The jets will remain  grounded for at least two weeks while AeroRepublica  supplies Civil Aeronautics with the paperwork and documents containing records  of the jet engines bought from the Alitalia company about four years ago. According to Civil Aeronautics Director Abel Enrique Jimenez Neira, the  Colombian airline did not achieve the aviation \"certification\" already granted  to Avianca, Aces, and Tampa.  \"As long as AeroRepublica is unable to meet the standards, it must wait and will  be barred from flying because of concerns for safety. They did not pass  inspection,\" Jimenez Neira said.  The official noted that the key issue that prompted the drastic measure is the  fact that AeroRepublica has no records for most of its jets. For now, the airline has the possibility of flying again with three of its nine  jets. It all depends on the results of the inspection that Civil Aeronautics  inspectors are planning to make in the next four days of the three jets that  have not been checked. If AeroRepublica is able to supply all of its documents in order, the three DC-9  jets will be allowed to fly. Otherwise, they will remain grounded like the rest  of the jets until the standards are met. The civil aeronautics director stated that the airline can also choose to bring  other planes into the country (leased) as long as they conform to international  aviation safety standards. Jimenez stated that the suspension of  operations does not mean that problems or  mechanical failures were detected on AeroRepublica jets, but that the deadline  ran out yesterday for the airline to comply with all safety standards in order  for it to be certified.  As is known, certification was a measure or an inspection that Civil Aeronautics  started implementing last year at the recommendation of the U.S. Federal  Aviation Administration (FAA), in compliance with the standards set forth by the  International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the world\\'s top organization  governing the airline industry. The certification process consisted of a Civil Aeronautics inspection of  operation manuals, pilot qualifications, maintenance files, and the aviation  practices used in order to determine if the airlines were adhering to  international standards. Precisely because it did not fulfill the duty of monitoring these checks and  balances with respect to Colombian airlines, the FAA decided in October 1995 to  lower Civil Aeronautics\\'s rating from category one to category two, after  determining that Civil Aeronautics was not performing its duty of monitoring  operations and that Colombian aviation was not safe enough. Last year, Civil Aeronautics certified the three Colombian airlines that have  regularly scheduled flights to the United States: Avianca, Aces, and Tampa. It  began the same certification process this year with domestic carriers, and  AeroRepublica was the first to be selected. After setting a deadline for the airline to submit all documents, Civil  Aeronautics found deficiencies in the records of the jets and engine turbines,  so it proceeded to ground the airline until it supplies the data. ', 'DHL Airline\\'s Safety Standards Questioned  The Belgian pilots\\' association BCA  has serious safety concerns about European Air Transport  (EAT), the Belgian airline which transports packages for DHL, operating out of  Zaventem Airport. The BCA is voicing its fears in the wake of a whole series of  complaints from members of staff at EAT. The maintenance of the aircraft is  \"below standard\" and the maximum number of hours flown by pilots is not being  respected, the BCA claims. What is more, EAT is primarily resorting to the  services of foreign pilots who pay no taxes or social security contributions  here.  More than half of EAT\\'s pilots have foreign identity cards. Most of them are  individuals who find their way to Belgium via British temporary employment  agencies specialized in air transport. According to the pilots\\' association, the  payment of social security contributions and taxes are being avoided, because if  they are being paid anywhere, it is certainly not in Belgium. For example,  Portuguese pilots have addresses in the United Kingdom where they never stay.  The pilots\\' association went to the public prosecutor\\'s office with its findings  18 months ago. The investigation being conducted by the labor inspectorate led  to a whole series of protocols and the establishment of infringements, but so  far no cases have found their way to court. Incidentally, EAT is by far from the  only airline employing large numbers of foreigners. Virgin also does so, for  example.  However, it is not just here that the shoe pinches. Various sources have  confirmed to us that these foreigners do virtually everything demanded of them  by EAT, bearing in mind their weak social position. One EAT pilot came to the  staggering conclusion that some Canadians had worked 28 nights in succession,  which violates all the rules. They do this so that they can subsequently enjoy a  few weeks\\' break in Canada. Admittedly EAT has been granted permission by the  Belgian Civil Aviation Authority to allow its personnel to work a bit longer  than the normal rule of eight days\\' flying, six days\\' rest, but the Authority  attached a whole series of conditions to this and definitely does not permit 28  days of uninterrupted service. For example, the pilots in question may not fly  by day. Yet more than 100 pilots working for the company confirmed in a petition  that they are having to do this.  One Belgian pilot on EAT\\'s books was deeply concerned at these duty times and  after complaining to no effect submitted a dossier crammed full of details of  violations to the Authority, only to be dismissed one week later for taking this  initiative. Apparently the management\\'s attention had been drawn to his dossier.   Officially, the French letter of dismissal described him, in French, as \"no  longer meeting our requirements.\" This was emphatically denied by other pilots.  \"He was one of our best flight officers,\" they said. \"A highly professional  pilot, always concerned about safety matters. His concern about the duty times  proves this. He only took steps after having flown on several occasions with  copilots who were overtired.\"  The pilots\\' association has also received a whole stack of complaints about  sub-standard maintenance and flight safety at EAT. For example, some technicians  have admitted that they receive bonuses depending on how much money is not spent  during maintenance. Some pilots have reported that they were forced to fly their  machine to Zaventem even after a technical fault had been detected, even when  the aircraft did not meet the required Minimum Equipment List. Meanwhile, in the  technical reports (called Trouble Reports), some defects are listed for several  successive days, with a technician writing in each case that the problem has  been resolved. Pilots confirm that the mandatory daily inspection by a  technician is often limited to signing the log book. This is referred to as \"a  daily EAT.\" EAT, by the way, has 20 aircraft of its own and charters around 40  more -- plus crew members -- from other airlines, including US companies. While  these aircraft operate out of Belgium, they do not fall under the strict Belgian  legislation and are therefore virtually impossible to monitor.   Agalev [Flemish Ecology Party] Deputy Lode Van Oost, who has put questions to  Transport Minister Michel Daerden on several occasions with regard to EAT, is  regularly told that the Authority has not detected any violations. \"I ask myself  how that can possibly be the case,\" Van Oost said. However, after yet another  question along similar lines was asked last week, the Authority has supposedly  now launched an investigation after all, which -- according to our sources --  has uncovered all kinds of irregularities. The pilots\\' association also recently  went to the Authority to talk about the problems at EAT. \"We have nothing  whatsoever against the company, but we are of the opinion that it must act in  accordance with the rules,\" the association\\'s president, Jean de Looze, said.  When asked for his reaction yesterday evening [29 June], EAT\\'s director of  operations, Iwein Van Caelenberg said that he knew there were problems with the  duty times and that these are currently under review. \"So we are working on it.\"  He pointed out that EAT has no option but to take foreign pilots into service  because there is a shortage of pilots in Belgium. According to Van Caelenberg,  the legislation here is not at all suitable for dealing with this \"irreversible  situation.\" He admits that the pilots signed a petition en masse, \"but the  questions were put so suggestively that they could not help but sign it.\" \"Just  like other airlines, safety is the single top priority at EAT and maintenance is  carried out by the book,\" Van Caelenberg added. \"There is no airline which gets  things right all the time and where there are no complainers.\"  ', \"State Council Approves Plan for Forming Police Force To Ensure Airline Safety      Beijing, 6 Feb (Xinhua) -- Liu Jianfeng, director of the Civil Aviation  Administration of China [CAAC], told Xinhua today that the State Council had  approved the plan for the restructuring of China's civil aviation  administration.   He said the plan includes the proposal of forming a people's  police force for China's airlines.         Liu Jianfeng disclosed that the police force will have about 2,000 men, whom  the CAAC Public Security Bureau will be assigned to different airlines.   He  added that the police force will be under the administration of the CAAC Public  Security Bureau and the domestic airlines.   Liu Jianfeng indicated that members  of the police force will primarily be assigned to major domestic and  international flights.         It is reported that departments concerned are now studying the details of  the formation of the police force in the air, and that the time for the  formation of the police force is still uncertain.         An authoritative source says that the move will enable China to ensure  passengers' travel safety by lawfully tightening the fight against aircraft  hijacking by terrorists.  \", \"Grounding of Royal Tongan Airline Over Safety Issues Isolates Pacific Islands      Tonga's royal family-owned international airline has been grounded over  safety concerns.       The airline flies a single Boeing-737 between Tonga, New Zealand, Fiji and  Australia, while operating two light aircraft domestically. It is the second  Pacific carrier grounded this month, after Australia temporarily grounded Air  Nauru earlier this month.       The grounding of Royal Tongan Airlines has left the Pacific state of Niue  isolated without a regular carrier, and many of Tonga's own islands now have no  airline service.  \", \"ROK's Yonhap: Gov't to Establish Civil Airline Safety Guidelines This Year         Seoul, Jan. 11 (Yonhap) -- Guidelines for civil aviation safety will be  set up to assure commercial airline safety during the 2002 World Cup finals, the  Ministry of Construction and Transportation said Friday.      The ministry said concerns over the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United  States and the country's hosting of the World Cup and Asian Games this year  prompted the new guidelines.      The safety guidelines will assign safety responsibilities to customs, the  Incheon International Airport, intelligence authorities and police, along with  procedures for security checks.      The guidelines will also include provisions for commercial airlines to  upgrade their security checks aboard the airplanes through security teams set up  within the airlines headed by airline executives.      A ministry task force will set up the safety guidelines in either March or  April.  \", 'Sardinian Investigation Reveals Spare PartsTrade Posing Threat to Airline Safety      Rome -- Imagine your automobile suffering a collision and, instead of  replacing the damaged forepart with a new section, your friendly neighborhood  mechanic goes off to a demolition dealer and buys one second-hand, maybe stolen.    In addition, your mechanic has a buddy who runs a spare parts warehouse, who  gives him a counterfeit bill certifying the purchase of the section in question.    Lastly, the mechanic slips his friend the warehouseman a \"little something for  his trouble.\"   It may even happen that it is the owner of the car, maybe to  make something on the insurance, who gets his mechanic to apply to the  demolition dealer.   Our story is about aircraft, and the safety and lives of  hundreds of passengers who fly every day on planes that might develop failures  and faults caused by worn-out spare parts are at stake.      \"Safe Wings,\" the Tempio Pausania [Sardinia] Public Prosecutor\\'s Office  investigation, has revealed this alarming situation:   the market in spare parts  and electronic flight instruments.   However, regardless of what the  investigation manages to prove in terms of criminal liability, it is already  clear -- as the ENAC [National Civil Aviation Board] initiative shows -- that  the Sardinian investigators\\' work has lifted the lid on a trade that has been  going on for years.      It was the night of 25 April 1999 when six bandits armed with had grenades  and kalashnikovs broke into the Olbia airport maintenance hangar and stole spare  parts.   Setting off from that robbery, Tempio Pausania\\'s Deputy Public  Prosecutor, Renato Perinu, came across an illegal trade in avionic equipment  obtained chiefly from the dismantling of damaged or decommissioned aircraft.    For the suspects\\' defense lawyers, of course, it was a normal spare parts  business.      The offences with which the suspects have been charged by Tempio Pausania  GIP [judge of the preliminary investigations -- who assesses whether the  defendants have a case to answer on the strength of the evidence] Paolo Ponassi  reveal an initial map of the airlines and companies involved in the trafficking,  which have purchased spare parts and flight instruments from companies by the  name of \"Newtech Italia SRL [limited liability company],\" \"Newtech Aerospace\"  (whose Managing Director, Gino Boselli, is under investigation), and  \"Panaviation SPA [joint-stock company]\" (whose Managing Director, Enzo  Fregonese, is under investigation).   The investigators are attempting to  establish the role played by Meridiana [Italian airline] too in the discarding  and sale of equipment.   Be that as it may, according to the investigators\\'  findings to date, the companies concerned have sold their wares to various  Italian airlines and US and Canadian companies:   Meridiana, Air One, Air  Dolomiti, Alpi Eagles, Air Sicilia, Azzurra, Minerca, and Volare, to name but  the Italian companies.   Then there are the foreign purchasers:   Air Stocks Inc  and Iunc Inc., Danbee-Mitchell, Aviation Sales Company, Flight Director Inc.,  International Airline Support Group, and Canada\\'s Pole Air2.      The charges made against the suspects largely involve three offences:    counterfeiting documents, posing a threat to public air transport safety, and  extortion, although the latter charge concerns only one of the suspects.   It is  the most serious crime, which allows the investigation to remain, for the time  being at least, in Tempio Pausania instead of being transferred to Rome.   The  episodes stated in the court order involve Paolo Pietro Corrias, a Meridiana SPA  employee, who is charged with obtaining 7 percent of the sum invoiced (over  31,500 euros in all) for supplies of aircraft parts bound for Meridiana from  Newtech Italia and Newtech Aerospace Managing Director Gino Boselli.   Corrias  is also charged with obtaining the same 7 percent (over 7,700 euros) from US  company Mitchell Air Kraft\\'s representative in Italy, George Schuster for  guaranteeing the supply of aircraft parts bound for Meridiana.   It also has to  be said, however, that GIP Ponassi herself states that \"there is no grave  evidence\" of Corrias \"being guilty of the crime of extortion.\"      To date, the Finance Police investigators have managed to ascertain the  origins of a tiny proportion of the material sold:   parts of the Canadair  C1-215 that crashed in Sicily in 1996, equipment (a fuel level indicator)  discarded by the ex-Adria Airways (former Yugoslavia), aircraft parts (from the  Canadair) obtained from Montalto Brothers of Palermo (who specialize in  demolishing written-off cars), and parts bought from the former Itavia.      The investigation by the Sardinian judiciary would appear to challenge the  very roots of this trade, the market in spare parts, instruments, and parts  already used and, consequently, considering the charges of \"posing a threat to  public air transport safety,\" already worn out and in any case not adequately  inspected.   The suspects\\' lawyers will, of course, put up a fight in the Tempio  Pausania court rooms, disputing the very premises of the investigation, which  lays the blame for jeopardizing flight safety on the go-betweens and sellers,  whereas, the defense claims, it was up to the purchasers, the airlines, to check  that the equipment was up to standard.      The key documentary evidence that, according to the prosecution, nails the  suspects is the \"counterfeiting of JAA Form One certificates,\" \"which enabled  them to sell aircraft parts falsely certified as new to various airlines.\"   The  case for the defense is that the international standards are actually  \"inadequate or inconsistent\":   \"The international standards issued by the JAA  (Joint Aviation Authority), which was established to bring together and into  line the standards in force in the member states of the European Community,  envisage the existence, and hence the compliance with those standards, of  aircraft spare parts distributors exempt from certification, prior  authorization, and compliance with specific standards for storing spare parts,  as all inspections, checks, and operations to ensure their efficiency, working  order, and proper documentation are incumbent on the certified user.\"   The  buyer, in other words.   There are, however, a number of documented episodes  from which far more elementary forms of counterfeiting emerge, as the GIP\\'s  order points out in connection with the Panaviation warehouse at Ciampino [Rome  airport]:   \"There is no denying the alarming fact that the use of counterfeit  documentation made it possible to sell parts of unknown origin.   A typical  instance is the finding, in the Ciampino hangar, of a number of compressor disks  from the Iberia airline, on which the label reading retirado, meaning withdrawn,  had been replaced with another reading O/H (standing for overhauled), thus  making it look as if the parts had been certified in good working order by the  airline itself, whereas it had actually declared them unusable.\"   However, the  GIP states in her order that she \"deems the nature of the forged quality  assurance certificates made out by the suspects to be on a par with that of  [forged] administrative certificates.\"      The investigation continues, and the magistrates have not yet questioned the  suspects arrested on Thursday.   The investigators are examining the paperwork  seized over the last few days.   The defense teams are already announcing that  they will fight the case before the Review Court. ', 'Air China To Invest More In Airline Safety      Beijing, June 12 (XINHUA) -- Air China will invest 270 million yuan (32.5  million U.S.   dollars) to ensure safety, 120 million yuan (14.5 million U.S.    dollars) of which is to be used for engine maintenance, sources with the company  said here Wednesday.      The company will increase safety education and training programs for pilots,  who will be tested more often.   And more special training will be given to  pilots in flight simulators.         Air China will place pilots into different route groups in compliance with  their abilities and pilots will be expected to make detailed studies of routes  and airports before take off.   And experts will study carefully complicated  routes, airports and the weather.      Meanwhile, Air China has pledged to complete examining 69 planes and all  engines as soon as possible in a bid to eliminate any hidden sources of trouble.    So far, more than 40 planes have been surveyed.   And sophisticated technology  will also be used to further enhance safety.    ', 'Russia to improve civil airline safety    Moscow, 21 December, RIA-Novosti correspondent Pavel Shevtsov: Russia is to  spend about R4bn on ensuring the safety of civilian flights in 2002. The  RIA-Novosti correspondent reports that this was stated on Friday by the first  deputy minister of transport, head of the state civil aviation service,  Aleksandr Neradko, when he spoke in the \"government hour\" at a plenary session  of the State Duma on questions of flight safety.   He said that in view of the increased number of accidents in civil air  transport, the requirements made on air carriers are to be tightened up;  companies which do not pay sufficient attention to ensuring flight safety will  lose their licences. Moreover, he stressed, aircraft are being replaced with  newer models and additional modern equipment is being installed on airliners,  which will make it possible to avoid many dangerous situations. A range of  measures has been drawn up to raise the qualifications of flight personnel.   After the terrorist acts in the USA on 11 September, Neradko pointed out,  joint measures had been taken with the power-wielding departments to step up the  guarding and monitoring of civil aviation facilities. ', 'Hoof and Mouth Disease Contagion Concern    Hoof and mouth disease, the very serious communicable  veterinary disease, has been reported in Greece. The State Veterinary Health  Inspection Service has warned all those returning home from Greece not to visit  Norwegian farms during the first two days following their return. The disease has also been reported in Albania, Turkey, and Macedonia. The  disease is spread through direct contact between animals but can also be spread  by humans.  Strict restrictions are imposed on animals and animal products from infected  herds are destroyed. The last outbreak of the disease in Norway occurred in  Ostfold and Vestfold in 1952. ', \"Hoof and Mouth Contaminated Areas Declared; PA Blamed  Over the past several weeks, 10 sites where hoof and  mouth disease has broken out have been located in Israel, four in the Negev and  six in the Galilee. The Agriculture Ministry's Veterinary Service declared the  Negev and the Galilee contaminated areas. This is the first time the disease has  broken out in the Negev since 1989.  Diseased herds were located in the Bedouin villages of Laghiayh, Rahat,  Qusayfah, and in Moshav Tidhar. In the Galilee, foci of the disease are in the  Arab villages of Sha'ab, Kafr Manda, Tamra, and Yirka, and in the moshavim of  Dishon and Dalton. Selling and buying cattle in these areas has been banned, and  transporting is allowed only by special approval. The farmers have been  instructed to take quarantine and sanitation measures and to prevent vehicles  from outside the location from moving near their sheds and barns. Prof. Arnon Shimshoni, head of the Veterinary Service, has said that the disease  has not yet spread to dairy farms, but there is fear it might. Ever since the  Palestinian Authority [PA] was established, there has been a rise in hoof and  mouth cases, and other animal diseases, due to the fact that cattle and sheep  are being smuggled in from the West Bank -- from the area of Hebron and  al-Zahiriyah to Bedouin villages of the northern Negev, and from Samaria to  minority villages in Western Galilee.  Prof. Shimshoni added that the unsupervised slaughter of animals practiced in  the minorities sector creates a danger of spreading another disease, acinococcus  [name as transliterated] -- a dangerous cattle disease that gets transferred to  humans through dogs. The disease breaks out because of poor hygienic conditions  and illegal slaughter. A resident of the village of Yirka recently died after  contracting the disease. Shimshoni complained that a detailed plan his office  prepared for combating the smuggling of animals, based on an evaluation of the  impact the PA might have on Israeli farms, was only partly approved and, he  said, the approved part has not been implemented. \", 'Alif Ba\\' on \\'Hoof and Mouth\\' Disease in Iraq  Baghdad Alif Ba\\' in Arabic on 3 March publishes on pages 20 and 21  a report by Rajihah \\'Abbud on the spreading of hoof and mouth disease among  livestock in Iraq, saying breeders have reported many deaths as a result of the  epidemic, which--they say--is due to scarcity of rainfalls and short supply of  drugs and vaccines from the Iraqi State Veterinary Organization.  The writer interviews Dr. Fadil \\'Abbas, director general of the State Veterinary  Organization, who says: The organization\\'s main job is preventive treatment.  But, there has been a big shortage of drugs and vaccines due to obstructions by  Sanctions Committee 661, which considers some of these drugs and vaccines of  dual usage. The late arrival of drug and vaccine consignments has also  contributed to the disaster, which lead to the loss of 65,000 livestock, mainly  sheep. This has happened for the first time, since Iraq had the best scientific  laboratory in the region for the production of vaccines against hoof and mouth  and other diseases, but it was destroyed by UN inspection teams.  [\\'Abbud] How do you distribute drugs under the memorandum of understanding?  [\\'Abbas] Distribution depends on the density of livestock and sudden appearance  of diseases in some areas.   [\\'Abbud] How do you implement preventive treatment?  [\\'Abbas] We used to produce all the drugs we needed. But, this is no longer the  case. Laboratories have been closed down due to outdated equipment and lack of  raw materials. To help us carry out preventive treatment, we have set up clinics  in remote areas. Scarcity of rainfall has led to malnutrition and the widespread  of hoof and mouth disease. But, it is dropping down now.   [\\'Abbud] Do you depend on private pharmaceutical factories for drug and vaccine  imports; and is there cheating in these imports?   [\\'Abbas] We are the ones who control the products of these factories through the  standard and quality control section. We are also the ones who recommend import  licenses. But, the hardships in importing some raw materials continue.  Concluding, the writer says: We concluded our tour by visiting al-Kindi Company,  which the Industry Ministry established in 1990 for the production of veterinary  drugs and vaccines. According to its acting General Manager Dr. Munaf Husayn,  the company does not produce all drugs and vaccines \"due to the aggression.\" Dr.  Husayn said: The company is finding it difficult to produce some vaccines due to  shortage of raw materials. UN inspection teams also used to interfere in our  work. The company was hit four times and several of its buildings were  destroyed.   ', \"Successful Campaign Against 'Hoof and Mouth' Disease  Dr. Dari 'Ulaywi, president of the Iraqi Veterinary  Union, has affirmed that the free vaccination campaign, which Agriculture  Ministry personnel have carried out recently against hoof and mouth disease, has  achieved tangible progress in controlling the disease, which has claimed many  animals. He said that follow-up work by Agriculture Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Ilah  Hamid, who provided all facilities and removed all obstacles facing veterinary  clinics throughout the country, has contributed to the success of this campaign  and the removal of the danger, which caused the death of a large number of  sheep, goats, cows, and buffalo.  It will be recalled that the main cause of epidemic is the UN inspection teams'  action in 1996 in destroying the whole factory that produced vaccines against  the disease.  \", \"ROK Reports DPRK 'Likely To Face' Hoof and Mouth Disease      The Russian news agency ITARTASS reported from Pyongyang Monday that North  Korea is likely to face large scale foot and mouth disease outbreak. The report  said some meat markets in the capital had closed and that foreign missions had  been issued warnings to thoroughly prepare meat. It added that the source of the  disease was likely to be on the country's border with China as Chinese farmers  were dumping dead diseased carcasses in the Yalu and Tumen rivers.  \", 'European Parliament Agriculture Commission President on Hoof and Mouth Crisis      Strasbourg - \"Without wanting to cultivate cynicism, it is not the worst  evil that the hoof and mouth disease crisis has occurred at this moment:   After  mad cow disease, it will force us to consider an in-depth reform of the Common  Agricultural Policy (CAP),\" according to Friedrich Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf,  president of the Agriculture and Rural Development Commission of the European  Parliament.   Graefe zu Baringdorf said bluntly what many people in Europe are  thinking at the moment:   That the hoof and mouth disease epizootic has given  the coup de grace to the 1962-version of the CAP (1962 was the year the CAP was  established).      Primacy of the Market       For this German Green aged 58, both the origins of BSE (Bovine Spongiform  Encephalopathy) and hoof and mouth disease lie in the productivism of the CAP.    \"It is the European industrial mode of production, which is affected,\" said  Graefe zu Baringdorf, an MEP (Member of the European Parliament), who is also a  farmer in Westphalia.   According to Graefe zu Baringdorf, there is no \"British  curse,\" despite the fact that BSE and hoof and mouth disease have hit this  country with full force.   \"The United Kingdom has in a way been chosen by  destiny to show to all of Europe how you should not run agriculture,\" he said.    The primacy of the market has led to the state abdicating its powers.   \"In both  cases, the UK administration did not show enough vigilance, and was late in  acting,\" Graefe zu Baringdorf said.   \"In the case of BSE, it continued to  export its contaminated animal feed to the continent until 1996.   In the case  of hoof and mouth disease, it allowed animals already affected by the disease to  be exported.\"   Speaking before the European Parliament yesterday, European  Commissioner for Health David Byrne confirmed that it was the import of  contaminated sheep on 16 February, which is the origin of the disease in France.      According to the president of the European Parliament\\'s Agriculture  Commission, \"the re-nationalization of agricultural policy\" would not change  anything, because trade is a necessity, since the European countries are unable  to aspire to self-sufficiency in food.   In addition, \"re-nationalization would  not an adapted response:   The vigilance of the public authorities must exist  inside each state,\" Graefe zu Baringdorf said.   \"But clearly in these two  cases, this is what was lacking.\"      But it is clear that the pursuit of profit regardless of the cost has had  its day.   \"It is necessary to say farewell to the idea of having a market  without rules,\" Graefe zu Baringdorf said.   The Greens are not alone in  thinking that the CAP must be re-orientated toward extensive agriculture, which  is respectful of the environment and health, and attentive to quality.   The  European Commission is on the same wavelength, as are Germany or Italy (it is no  coincidence that these two countries have appointed ecologists to be their  agriculture ministers).   Even France, the architect of the current CAP, is  starting to move:   Only French President Jacques Chirac is still showing any  resistance to an in-depth reform.   Recently Chirac gave a reminder that the  reform of the CAP \"is not on the agenda.\"   The president has not forgotten that  it was himself, who was behind the productivist and pro-market choices of  European agriculture, when he was the agriculture minister under President  Pompidou.   Quite obviously, only a Franco-German initiative could get a reform  moving, stressed Graefe zu Baringdorf.      Health Controls      Although high-quality agriculture is necessary, it is necessary to go  further in bringing the free market into question.   Health controls must be  re-thought.   \"The European system is inadequate:   It is not normal that France  is unable to check UK foodstuffs,\" in the name of the free movement of goods,  Graefe zu Baringdorf said.   \"Clearly there is a danger in trusting the checks  of exporting countries, which could be influenced by economic considerations.\"    According to Graefe zu Baringdorf, it is necessary to institute controls in  importing countries, which will be orientated more toward the health of  consumers.      Emergency      Similarly, it is necessary to be able to trace shipments of all agricultural  products.   \"Vigilance must exist in \\'peace time,\\'\" said Graefe zu Baringdorf.    \"People have the feeling that the administrations do not do anything, except in  the event of a crisis.   And in that case, embargoes are decided as a matter of  urgency.   States should be in a permanent state of emergency.\" ', 'Impact of Hoof and Mouth Epidemic on Franco-German Relations Viewed      The outbreak of hoof and mouth disease in France created a strange backdrop  for the meeting of French and German foreign and agriculture ministers in Paris  on the evening of Tuesday 13 March, to resolve the dispute over European  agriculture policy that has existed between their two countries since the Berlin  summit of March 1999.   With the crisis perhaps helping to restore a  level-headed approach, it was acknowledged that, despite the harsh language of  recent months concerning the costs and causes of the crisis, there were possible  points of rapprochement      According to diplomatic sources, the feeling, following the dinner at the  Quai d\\'Orsay [Foreign Ministry], was that the convergences were \"stronger than  expected.\"   Discussions will continue on \"identifying the problems and  challenges to be met in order to build a quality agriculture, taking account of  the imperatives of food safety, using in the immediate term the freedom of  movement permitted by the Berlin agreements.\"      This unusual meeting, which brought together two of Lionel Jospin\\'s  ministers, Hubert Vedrine and Jean Glavany, and the two leading German Greens  representatives within the Schroeder team, Joschka Fischer and Renate Kuenst,  was set within the framework of the two capitals\\' current efforts to try to  restore less uneasy relations by resolving topics of friction.   There have been  several meetings since January, following the crisis sparked by the Nice summit.    President Chirac, the Prime Minister, and Chancellor Schroeder will be meeting  in Herxheim 20 March in order to review the exploratory work that they have  entrusted to their foreign ministers.      The crisis experienced by stock farming, a real   challenge to the EU\\'s  cohesion, has revived suspicions.   Confronted with the scale of the  repercussions on the rural fabric, France wanted more aid, whereas Germany has  rejected the rationale of endless subsidies.   The outbreak of hoof and mouth  disease has exacerbated the climate, all governments being obliged to step up  precautionary measures.   Having tried to confine the virus to the other side of  the Channel, France in turn is now in quarantine.   Several German Laender have  announced the destruction of animals that have arrived in recent weeks from  French areas at risk and have urged their citizens to limit travel to France.      Realization [subhead]      Paradoxically, however, the first cases of mad cow\\'s disease to appear in  Germany, last fall, created a more favorable situation for dialogue.   Having  been tasked in January with reappraising Germany\\'s agricultural policy, the new  Agriculture Minister promptly called for a radial change of course.   \"Quality  rather than mass production,\" was the watchword reaffirmed this weekend by the  German Greens\\' Congress in Stuttgart.   This turnabout, which is causing anxiety  within the profession, especially in France, nevertheless reflects the  realization in Germany both that farming is not just a matter for farmers and  also that, even within our urban societies, it extends to more a more complex  range of factors.      France\\'s Socialist government, which has worked since its accession to power  to promote agriculture more respectful of its environment, by offering farmers  new land use contracts, is ready to take the Germans at their word.   It was  easy for French Agriculture Minister to point out, in an interview published by  Les Echos 8 March, that Germany also opposed a modification of aid for quality  agriculture, and has not hitherto used the opportunities opened up in this  direction by the Berlin agreements.   Anticipating the German Greens\\' Congress,  he argued the need for farmers to \"reach a new contract with society to move on  from producing more to producing better.\"   He said that when the time for the  review of CAP comes in 2003, \"it would be useful to be able to issue strong  political signals, showing that we have learned our lessons from the crises and  received the message from the public.\" ', \"France's Glavany cited on BSE, Hoof and Mouth Measures      [Le Figaro] According to the latest AFSSA [French Food Health Safety Agency]  findings, none of the suspected areas, apart from Mayenne, has proved to have  been contaminated by hoof and mouth disease.   Can we consider France to have  extricated itself from the crisis?      [Glavany] I wish this were so!   Our confidence increases with every passing  day, but it is to early to proclaim victory.   The phenomenon is far from having  been brought under control in the UK: the authorities are pursuing it  intensively.   With so many new outbreaks daily there -- that is, on our  doorstep -- there is a great risk; the wind or the thousands of tourists and  trucks crossing the Channel every day could bring the virus in.      [Le Figaro] But has the battle been won as regards the risk of direct  contamination by sheep imported from the UK between 1 and 21 February?      [Glavany] Let us say that it is on the way to being so.   This is why I have  asked Europe to lighten the restrictive measures that it imposed on us as soon  as possible, on the basis of the provisions that France has adopted.   As a  precaution, we have slaughtered 40,000 British sheep or sheep that were in  contact with British sheep, and we have introduced safety boundaries.   France  has decided to hit hard and fast, and we are now seeing that this is what had to  be done.   I would feel more reassured if our neighbors had done thee same.      [Le Figaro] What do you mean?     [Glavany] I am not sure that everyone has monitored British imports as we  have.   One of the lessons of this crisis is, in passing, that Europe must make  progress with regard to traceability of sheep.   The British say that we are not  the only ones to whom they supplied sheep during the critical period.   I am not  talking about protective or preventive slaughter measures elsewhere, expect in  the Netherlands.      [Le Figaro] Are you saying this because Europe has not been kind to France?      [Glavany] The European institutions have functioned well.   It is, rather,  outside the EU that there has been a hastiness to do more than necessary and to  confuse mercenary considerations with the precaution principle.   But, compared  to our neighbors, it is true that it is better not to go down on your knee: it  being the foremost agricultural and animal farming power, France will evidently  not be excused any weakness...      [Le Figaro] Francois d'Aubert, Deputy for Mayenne, wants to appeal to the  European Court of Justice, since he considers the embargoes on Orne and Mayenne  illegal.   What is your opinion?      [Glavany] I do not encourage Francois d'Aubert to attack the European  decision.   Europe cannot be criticized for doing its job.   Some countries  wanted to have us subjected to a blockade affecting the whole of our territory.    We succeeded in confining it to these two departments, which served as our  health shield.   In view of the sacrifice that is being demanded of them, they  must enjoy the nation's support.      [Le Figaro] Despite all the measures adopted to limit the spread of the  illness, French people remain skeptical, and the consumption of lamb has fallen  by almost 30 percent during the past month...      [Glavany] This is critical, particularly since this illness is not dangerous  to human beings.   The message that we are driving home, Health Minister Bernard  Kouchner and I, is clear, however.   This is indeed an animal health problem,  not a public health problem.   There is no reason for this drop in consumption.    But it is true that the succession of crises, BSE and then hoof and mouth  disease, is causing reflex responses among the public.   The pictures of  slaughter houses and pyres shown on television over the past month have played a  frightening role and explain this rejection.   We really must abandon this  disastrous psychosis as soon as possible, because it is having a domino effect:  I have even been told that reservations at rural holiday camps in Mayenne have  been canceled!      [Le Figaro] The main victims are the farmers.   Do you understand their  distress?         [Glavany] Of course   Any sector of society that were to experience what  they are experiencing would ask questions about their purpose and their future.    They are at the end of their tether, but who would not be so?   This is why  they must be given not only financial, but also moral support.   They are  suffering the effects of two crises.   Consumption has fallen by 50 percent and  exports by 980 percent.   In the case of hood and mouth disease, we must be  brave enough to resolutely pursue the measures that we have adopted. This will  make it possible to lift them as soon as possible.   In the case of BSE, we must  accelerate and increase economic support to the sector.   I am worried to see  that very few countries in Europe are implementing the programs for the purchase  and destruction of cattle over 30 months old decided on 2 January.   We have  considerable surpluses.   Hundreds of thousands of heads of cattle need to be  slaughtered in Europe, including young heifers, in order to restore a balance  between supply and demand.   The countries of the North oppose this.   But if we  not do it, we will cause this crisis to drag on for months and months.      [Le Figaro] We are clinging to the rationale of an agricultural economy on a  drip.   Should CAP [Common Agricultural Policy] not be called into question?      [Glavany] I admit that the industry's economic dependency is hard to accept,  both for the public and for farmers themselves.   But I do not want to envisage  a non-subsidized European policy, because that would reduce the number of  farmers from 680,000 to 150,000, with all the repercussions that this would have  on land management and the balance of society.   However, I do think that  subsidies are badly allocated and that CAP must be reoriented.   But this is a  separate debate, and it is not topical at a time of crisis. \", 'Lending Rates Rise as \\'Mortgage Price War\\' Ends  The two biggest mortgage lenders yesterday  signalled the end of the mortgage price war by raising their lending rates for  the second time in two months.  The rate for new loans goes up by 25 basis points to 9.75 per cent.  The move by Hongkong Bank and its subsidiary Hang Seng Bank, which together  provide a quarter of the SAR\\'s residential mortgage loans, is expected to exert  a dampening effect on the property market.  Prospective home-buyers face bigger monthly repayment bills, as the mortgage  rate is lifted to one per cent over the prime lending rate of 8.75 per cent. For  a $2 million loan, repayable over 20 years, borrowers will have to pay $322 more  a month.   The vicious mortgage price war waged in the first half of the year culminated in  a sharp increase in banks\\' residential loan volumes.  Hongkong Bank general manager Chris Langley said: \"The increase is a reflection  of the continual change of the availability of funds for property lending.  \"It is also a reflection that the very low rates since the beginning of this  year have become unsustainable. The rates are now back to a more normal level.\"  During the price war, flat buyers could obtain a rate as low as 8.75 per cent.  The move came a month after Hongkong Bank pushed up the rate for luxury  apartments, those valued at $20 million or above, to 9.75 per cent from 9.5 per  cent. But the bank said it had abolished the two-tier structure and would charge  the same mortgage rate irrespective of loan size.  A Hang Seng Bank spokeswoman said it moved up the rate offered to its favourable  customers from 9.25 per cent to 9.5 per cent, while the rate for walk-in  customers was 9.75 per cent.   \"Even good customers will find it hard to get a mortgage loan at 9.25 per cent  these days,\" she said. The increase was \"a response to market conditions\".  After competing fiercely for mortgage loans in the first half, banks have been  gradually putting up rates since August, when the Hong Kong Monetary Authority  issued a stern letter warning against reckless mortgage loan growth in late  July.  The authority expressed concern over banks\\' property exposure, which in some  cases was well over 40 per cent of their total  Hongkong Bank and Chase Manhattan Bank responded in early August by increasing  the rates by 25 basis points to 9.5 per cent, a move followed widely by their  peers.   The impact of the rate increase was immediately felt as banks\\' mortgage lending  slowed down in August.  Gross new loans made for that month fell 23.3 per cent to $ ,24.9 billion,  against a rise in July of 27.3 per cent, according to the Monetary Authority.  New loans approved also fell 23.7 per cent to $25.7 billion.  ln late September, Standard Chartered Bank took the bold step of raising the  mortgage rate to a higher level of 9.75 per cent. Other banks charged 10 per  cent for all walk-in clients.  Banking analysts reckoned the sharp growth in mortgage loans in the first half  had given banks sufficient business for the year.  ', \"Prodi Hails First Cut in Mortgage Rates to 5 Percent  Now on to an issue which affects millions of Italians:  expensive mortgages. Following the decision by the Popular Bank of Milan to  lower its rate to 5 percent, a short time ago [Prime Minister] Prodi, speaking  in Bologna, reaffirmed that the target of 5 percent is no act of charity, but  the result of the sorting out of Italy's economy. [passage omitted]  [Begin recording] [Prodi] I believe the news is good, because for months and  months now I have been saying that if we sort out the fundamentals of the  economy, we could have mortgages at 5 five percent. We have got there, and I  think that now we can move on. It is important, because now young people who  have a job, not a marvelous job, but a basic job, can begin to think of buying a  home, as my generation did. With mortgages at five percent, one can start to put  something aside so as to able to buy a home. Of course, it is clear that the  poorest sections of society must be protected in another way, and we will do  this. Meanwhile, this is an incredible leap forward. The bank which took this  step, the Popular Bank of Milan, did so however not out of charity. It did so  because it can do it, given that the fundamentals of the economy are healthy.  There is convergence with rates in other countries, and thus it is one of the  fruits of the policy to join Europe.   [Unidentified correspondent] Will people who pay off one mortgage, so as to  negotiate another mortgage at a lower rate, lose their tax breaks?   [Prodi] These terms are for new mortgages, you see. As I have said before, all  of us -- banks, government, consumers' associations -- will have to pay a lot of  attention to existing mortgages, because it is clear that once a mortgage is  agreed, it is agreed. But, in the face of these great changes, we must look for  a solution for existing mortgages too. [end recording]  \", 'Prodi Insists on Lowering Mortgage Rates  (ANSA) -- Rome, April 24 -- Premier Romano Prodi today  reiterated his government\\'s commitment to bringing Italy\\'s mortgage rates down  to 5% in the midst of heated dispute over the reluctance of commercial banks to  lower their rates in the wake of the Bank of Italy\\'s discount rate reduction  Tuesday.   Speaking during question time in the Lower House, the premier named his  government\\'s involvement with banks and credit institutions aimed at rolling  back mortgage rates and said that to date, he has been greatly satisfied.  \"When I talked of the dream of 5%, the rate was 14% and now it is 6.25%. I think  we can get there is a fairly short time,\" he affirmed and said his \"dream\" was  based on policy which included curbing inflation.  After noting that the level of costs within the Italian banking system is  greater than that abroad, he said, \"But today banks have room to lower new  mortgage rates because of the low level reached by interest paid on new  deposits.   \"I think the virtuous circle can be closed like this.\"  He mentioned the need for surveillance for removing such obstacles as lending  guarantees and other procedures surrounding mortgages and concluded his remarks  by saying, \"The 5% mortgage is a feature of civilization, a way for workers to  have a home.\"  Earlier in the day, Cabinet Undersecretary Enrico Micheli said the banking  system must attain greater efficiency which will pave the way to greater  flexibility on mortgage rates.   With reference to reports that banks said they would be unable to meet the 5%  rate goal without government subsidies, Micheli said he could rule out \"state  aid, though this was discussed only at the level of the information media.\"  What is needed, he said, is \"the independent action of the banks\" on this front  because subsidies are \"old and outdated\".  ', 'CNA: Pm Asks For Lower Mortgage Rate For Quake-affected Victims         Taipei, Dec. 19 (CNA) -- Premier Yu Shyi-kun instructed the Ministry of  Finance Thursday to coordinate domestic banks within a week to adjust downwards  the mortgage rate for victims of the disastrous earthquake of three years ago,  with 4 percent as the goal.      The premier issued the instruction as the 921 Earthquake Post-Disaster  Recovery Commission met for the 20th time since the killer temblor hit Taiwan  Sept. 21, 1999, with central Taiwan bearing the brunt of the casualties and  damage.      The Ministry of Finance invited the commission, the Central Bank of China,  and various financial institutions to a meeting Oct 22, during which the  participants agreed to cut the mortgage loan rate to not higher than 5 percent.      Yu said that the rates must be further cut to below 4 percent, adding that  the government will subsidize the gap of 1 percent if the loan rate remains at 5  percent.   The measure will be retroactive to January this year and it is  estimated that 28,900 affected households will benefit.      The participants also proposed a project to streamline the procedures for  rebuilding simple houses of aborigines and rural communities in quake-affected  regions.      The participants also agreed to extend the health insurance subsidies for  the affected victims, such as those over 65, children under three, and those who  suffered serious injuries in the earthquake, for another year.   It is estimated  that this will cost the government NT$650 million (US$18.57 million).    ', 'Japan: Weekly Questions Takenaka\\'s Personal Financial Transactions      Whether Japan can successfully reform its ailing economy by accelerating the  bailout of the huge amount of bad loans held by banks is now attracting the rapt  attention of the world.      Japan\\'s success in solving this problem depends on Financial Affairs  Minister Heizo Takenaka. Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, who has been  criticized as a leader who does not understand the economy, appointed Mr.  Takanaka to two minister-level posts - Minister of Economic and Financial  Policies and Minister of Financial Affairs - when he reshuffled his cabinet.  This indicates that Prime Minister Koizumi has given Mr. Takenaka full authority  over the formulation and implementation of economic and financial policies.       When Mr. Takenaka assumed his two minister-level positions, he announced the  names of the banks and companies that would be allowed to go bankrupt. Also, he  organized a special task force, selecting scholars, economic specialists and  consultants who have been seeking a hard landing after making changes in Japan\\'s  financial system.       Mr. Takenaka\\'s bold policies were met with strong opposition from members of  the government and even the ruling parties. Also, banking industry executives  attacked Mr. Takenaka\\'s policies.       Mr. Takenaka has not begun to implement his policies yet. The Tokyo Stock  Market has reacted negatively to Mr. Takenaka\\'s new policies as indicated by  continuous declines in stock prices.       Criticism is not only being leveled at Mr. Tanaka\\'s policies but also about  his personal real estate investments as well as his ways of avoiding taxes. The  criticism of his private financial matters is amplifying the nation\\'s doubt  about him. Mr. Takenaka seems to be creating more enemies than necessary.       The Weekly Post has found more dubious financial transactions involving 200  million yen (approx. $1.67 million) in loans suspected to have been made by the  banks with special treatment because of Mr. Takenaka\\'s minister positions.       1. Luxurious Summer House      Last week on this web site, The Weekly Post (TWP) reported on doubtful real  estate transactions made by Heizo Takenaka who has two powerful financial posts  - Minister of Economic and Financial Policies and Minister of Financial Affairs  - in the Koizumi Administration.       Now, TWP\\'s investigation has found that Mr. Takenaka received special  treatment from banks in his loan arrangement.       Over the last several years, the public document provided by Financial  Affairs Minister Takenaka on his assets indicated that he acquired four  properties.       In 1997, Mr. Takenaka purchased a summer house in Katsuura City, Chiba  Prefecture. This large summer house stands on the top of a hill which provides a  splendid view of the ocean. The house has wonderful contrasts between white  walls and a red colored roof, which makes the house stand out among its  neighbors.       The summer house has two-story and 522 square meters of living space. The  land was registered in the names of Mr. and Mrs. Takenaka, but the house is  owned by Hayes Research Center Inc., which used to be owned by Mr. Takanaka.             The businesses of Hayes Research Center include the management of Mr.  Takenaka\\'s lectures and research works requested by the central and local  governments. In April of last year when Mr. Takenaka was appointed Minister of  Economic and Financial Policies, ownership of the company was transferred to  Mrs. Takenaka.       At a press conference that was held as soon as he assumed the minister  position, Mr. Takenaka answered questions regarding the ownership of his summer  house by his company, \"It is not accurate to describe the house as a summer  house. It is a facility to be used for seminars that Hayes Research Center  provides. Hayes Inc. is a research firm. They also send lecturers to our  clients. Mostly, it deals with arranging my lectures. I am a university  professor and have been planning to get involved in the seminar business with  Hayes Inc. Therefore, the house is owned by Hayes Inc.\"       If the property is owned by a corporation, loan payments and maintenance  costs can be expensed. This reduces the amount of taxes paid by Mr. Takenaka  personally.       The Bank of Yokohama financed 40 million yen (approx. $300,000) at  2.925-percent interest for Mr. Takenaka\\'s purchase of the summer house. In  September 1999, after two years of this loan arrangement, Mr. Takenaka paid off  the entire balance this loan.       Since then, Mr. Takenaka has been investing in other real estate properties.        2. Down Payment Too Small      In March of 1999, Mr. Takenaka purchased three luxury condominium apartments  on the same day. The 54 storey building is called the \"Okawabata Liberty City  21\\' and is located in the central part of downtown Tokyo.             Mr. Takenaka acquired a 21st-floor unit for 49.9 million yen (approx.  $410,000) in cash under the name of Hayes Research Center Inc.       He purchased a unit on the 31st-floor for 93 million yen (approx. $775,000).  He borrowed 34.2 million yen (approx. $285,000) from Housing Loan Corporation  and 35.1 million yen (approx. $292,000) from Asahi Bank. The loan amounts from  the two banks suggest that Mr. Takenaka made a 30-million yen (approx. $250,000)  down payment.       After only 10 months, Mr. Takenaka paid off all of the 70-million yen  outstanding balance of his loans and let Hayes Research Center Inc. acquire his  31st-floor unit. The title was transferred to Hayes.       In the same year, Mr. Takenaka paid off the 40-million yen loan balance for  his summer house as well. In addition, he purchased another condominium unit  priced at 50 million yen (approx. $417,000) in cash in the same year.       His total use of cash amounted to 160 million yen (approx. $1.33 million)  that year.       Soon after paying 160 million yen, Mr. Takenaka purchased a more expensive  condominium in the same building where his family currently lives. The price of  the unit was 181 million yen (approx. $1.51 million). A 170-million yen (approx.  $1.42 million) mortgage was arranged with Asahi Bank under the title of Mr. and  Mrs. Takenaka.       Their down payment was only 11 million yen (approx. $92,000) - only 6.5  percent of the entire mortgage. In Japan, it is unusual for anyone to borrow  such a large amount of money with such a small down payment.       Did the bank give Mr. Takenaka special treatment? The mortgage bank, Risona  Holding Co. owned by Asahi Bank, said to The Weekly Post, \"We cannot answer any  questions about individual transactions.\"       Under a non disclosure of identity agreement, one loan manager at a major  bank said, \"Banks are approving loans based on a manual provided by the  Financial Services Agency.  Under no circumstances would a bank approve a 170-million yen loan for a  181-million yen property as was granted to Mr. Takenaka,       \"Normally, housing loans are approved for 60 percent of the price that  buyers pay for properties. In Mr. Takenaka\\'s case, it should have been about 100  million yen. It should be limited to 144 million, 80 percent of the price he  paid. So, I assume that the mortgage bank did a special favor for Mr. Takenaka  for a special reason.\"       The inspection manual of the Financial Services Agency (FSA) defines that  the bailout amount of mortgaged real estate properties should be less than 70  percent of the appraised value. This guideline was made in order to secure loans  from banks. If banks make loans greater than 70 percent of the property value,  FSA inspectors may require them to take additional securities from the borrower.  Banks should avoid such mortgages.       When Asahi Bank gave the 170-million yen mortgage to Mr. Takenaka in April  2000, he did not hold a minister position. However, Mr. Takenaka had already  been a member of the Economic Strategy Committee attached to then Prime Minister  Obuchi. He had political power.      It is not an unreasonable assumption that Asahi Bank did a special favor for  Mr. Takenaka because of his position.       3. Outrageously Low Interest Rate      Since he was given minister positions, Mr. Takanaka has been receiving  special treatment from banks.       On January 18, Mr. Takenata paid back in full the 170-million yen housing  loan to Asahi Bank and, on the same day, he obtained a 50-million yen (approx.  $417,000) new loan from Tokyo-Mitsubishi Bank putting up his 47th-floor  condominium apartment as security.       The mortgage rate was set at 1.2 percent. At that time, the prevailing  mortgage rates of banks were above the two-percent level. Mr. Takenaka seemed to  have refinanced his mortgage by moving to Tokyo-Mitsubishi Bank which gave him  the lower rate.       Also, his mortgage amount decreased from 170 million yen to 50 million yen.  Even considering his sales proceeds from one condominium which took place two  months before, his 120-million yen (approx. $1 million) pay-off of the mortgage  shows his high earnings as well as a nice cash flow.       However, Yukio Sakurai, a critic of housing said, \"When banks give housing  loans, they take collateral and involve loan guarantee corporations in the  middle to establish dual security for the loans. In the case of Mr. Takenaka,  Tokyo-Mitsubishi did not get a loan guarantee corporation involved. So, the loan  is considered to be a regular loan, not a housing loan. In this case, the 1.2  percent rate applied to his loan was too low.\"       The aforementioned banker who is in charge of lending at a major bank said,  \"The loan from Tokyo-Mitsubishi Bank to Mr. Takenaka is an ordinary loan for  real estate acquisition given to small- and medium-size corporations. Currently,  the rates of such loans are 4 to 8 percent because the FSA is guiding banks to  keep rates high for loans to business corporations,       \"Even for loans made to major corporations, banks charge 3 percent interest.  The 1.2 percent rate granted to Mr. Takenaka seems to only be given to group  corporations of the bank.\" Normally in Japan, banks give better rates to its  group companies.       What the source said was that Tokyo-Mitsubishi Bank gave a rate to Mr.  Takenaka as low as it gives to Mitsubishi-group corporations.       The Public Communication Department at Tokyo-Mitsubishi Bank replied to  questions posed by TWP, \"Due to requirements for privacy protection, we cannot  answer your question.\"       Minister of Financial Affairs Takenaka has already launched policies aimed  at tightening inspections made by the FSA on banks and injecting public money  into ailing banks. He also announced that he would pursue more severely the  responsibilities of top management for having led their banks into financial  problems by mismanagement.       On October 18, the FSA issued management improvement order to UFJ Bank which  cut 2.5 trillion yen (approx. $20.8 billion) in loans to small- and medium-size  corporations.       Also, on the same day, the FSA issued management order to Asahi Bank which  stole 1.4 trillion yen (approx. $11.7 billion) existing loans from other banks.  It may not be faire to criticize Mr. Takenaka, but, he may deserve the criticism  that, since Mr. Takenaka paid off all mortgage to Asahi Bank, he might have felt  free for punishing Asahi Bank.       Mr. Takenaka is the responsible minister of the FSA. While Japan\\'s small-  and medium-size corporations are suffering from the credit crunch of banks for  loans and banks\\' raising interest rates for them, only Mr. Takenaka is receiving  sweet deals.       The TWP contacted Mr. Takenaka and raised the question. He replied, \"I will  not answer your question.\" That was his only answer.  Shukan Posuto [The Weekly Post] (Internet Version-WWW)  ', 'Government To Limit Increases in Mortgage Rates  Tokyo, March 18 Kyodo -- The construction and finance  ministries have agreed to limit increases in government-sponsored mortgage rates  in order to maintain brisk home building activity, sources at the ministries  said.  The benchmark lending rate of the government-affiliated Housing Loan Corp. will  be lifted to 2.4 percent per annum from 2.2. percent now, the sources said. This  is lower than a hike to 2.85 percent required to meet the rising borrowing costs  of Housing Loan Corp.  Construction Minister Katsutsugu Sekiya will report the planned hike at a  cabinet meeting on Friday, the sources said.  New rates will be offered from March 29 on loans to purchase built-homes as well  as loans for home reforms. For loans solicited by individuals who arrange to  have homes built, new rates will be applied from around early May.  Since the government lowered the benchmark rate to a record low 2 percent late  last year, house and condominium sales have been rising.  In order to ensure an economic recovery, it is deemed necessary for the  government to keep mortgage rates low so that housing investments can be kept at  a strong level.  ', \"Major Japan banks to raise fixed mortgage rates      Tokyo, Aug. 31 Kyodo -- Nine major Japanese banks said Thursday they will  raise their fixed mortgage rates from Friday in response to the Bank of Japan's  (BOJ) decision to end its zero-interest rate policy.      The size of the rate rises ranges from 0.05 to 0.20 percentage point.      For 3-year mortgages, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and five other banks will  raise the rate to 2.40%, Fuji Bank to 2.45%, Daiwa Bank to 2.30% and Asahi Bank  to 2.00%.      For 10-year mortgages, Sanwa and Sakura banks and three other banks will  boost the rate to 3.50%, Fuji Bank to 3.75%, Tokai Bank to 3.55%, and Asahi and  Daiwa banks to 3.20%.      Earlier this month, the BOJ scrapped the 18-month-old policy of guiding the  key unsecured overnight call money rate to near zero, setting the new target at  around 0.25%. \", 'Prodi, Banks Engage in Mortgage Row  (ANSA) -- Rome, April 22 -- A row on high mortgage rates  rumbled on today as consumers threatened legal action and a leading Italian  mortgage institute accused a British bank of unfair competition.  The row was sparked yesterday by a sharp exchange between Italian Premier Romano  Prodi and the president of the Italian Banking Association, Tancredi Bianchi.  Prodi hailed Tuesday\\'s [21 April] night cut in the Bank of Italy\\'s discount rate  as paving the way for 5% mortgage, a \"cherished goal\" of his economic policy.  Bianchi replied that banks had no intention of cutting mortgage rates so low,  without some form of government subsidy.  Commentators in today\\'s press tended to side with Prodi against the big banks  which are swift to raise rates but slow to cut them.  A Corriere della Sera leader accused the banks of penalising home-owners at the  expense of bigger clients to whom they offer seemingly unlimited credit.  Today, a top official at a leading mortgage and investment institute, Fonspa,  Renato Cassaro, accused UK bank Abbey National of \"unfair competition\" in  offering mortgage rates that are even lower than the 5% cited by Prodi.  Cassaro claimed that Abbey\\'s rate would turn out to be \"exactly the same as our  own 6.5%\" if the proper calculations were made.  He said Abbey was \"misleading customers,\" an alleged crime that was all the more  serious, he claimed, \"on the part of a country that it isn\\'t even in EMU  [Economic and Monetary Union].\"   Abbey recently began trading in Italy, spearheading what the press has billed as  \"a foreign invasion\".  Cassaro also advanced a proposal for solving the mortgage problem: scrapping all  pre-existing contracts and re-negotiating them.  That way, he said, low-rate credit for companies and other big customers could  be raised and high-rate credit to home- owners could be lowered.  The Italian Banking Association meanwhile announced it was keeping to a press  black-out after yesterday\\'s flap.  It denied asking the government for money to help its members lower mortgage  rates.   Premier Prodi commented wryly: \"Well, I see they\\'ve done everything by  themselves... first they asked for (subsidies), then they took them back.\"  A consumers\\' association, Adiconsum, repeated a threat to take legal action  against banks which have not lowered mortgage rates despite a succession of cuts  in the Bank of Italy\\'s discount rates.  Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi said the state couldn\\'t step in between  banks and customers to get fairer mortgages.  Speaking in the Senate, he acknowledged that the issue was \"delicate\" but  stressed: \"mortgages are contracts between autonomous and independent subjects  and I do not see why there should be intervention on the part of the state.\"  Ciampi said he had received no request from ABI.  He did not comment on Passaro\\'s idea of using tax credits as an incentive for  rewriting mortgage terms.   Opposition economic spokesman Antonio Marzano said mortgage- holders should be  allowed to renegotiate their terms when the borrowing environment changed,  without the stiff penalties at present envisaged.  \"It is clear that the bargaining power in drafting mortgages is always tilted  towards the banks, but they must use it in a reasonable way,\" he said.  Marzano claimed that Premier Prodi had been guilty of a sophomoric mistake in  assuming that the Bank of Italy discount rate should be the same as the rates  applied by banks to loans and mortgages.  He also pointed out that the European Monetary Institute, forerunner of the  future European Central Bank, \"envisages interest rates at 6% to support the  euro.\"  \"This wishful thinking based on nothing amounts to pure demagoguery,\" Marzano  claimed.   Abbey National issued a statement replying to Cassaro\\'s allegation and to  similar claims by Tancredi Bianchi, carried in the press this morning.  Abbey National confirmed that its mortgages rates are between 4 and 5% and \"do  not conceal any commission costs.\"  It also noted that \"we did not ask for any state subsidies in order to apply  these rates.\"  Abbey described Tancredi\\'s claims as \"false and offensive.\"  It also pointed out that it may be a foreign bank but it is also a European  Union bank operating under the same conditions as Italian banks abroad.  It therefore called on Tancredi Bianchi to \"swiftly rectify his statements.\"  In today\\'s Italian newspapers the ABI chief was quoted as claiming that Abbey\\'s  4% rate did not include commission costs.  Also this evening, another British bank, the Woolwich, announced a new mortgage  to be launched in May at 4.5%.  It will be index-linked to the Swiss franc and will have a maximum length of 15  years, the Woolwich said.  ']\n"

THE MAINTENANCE OF THE AIRCRAFT IS `` BELOW STANDARD '' AND THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF HOUR FLOWN BY PILOT IS NOT BEING RESPECTED , THE BCA CLAIM . WHAT IS MORE , EAT IS PRIMARILY RESORTING TO THE SERVICE OF FOREIGN PILOT WHO PAY NO TAX OR SOCIAL SECURITY CONTRIBUTION HERE . MORE THAN HALF OF EAT 'S PILOT HAVE FOREIGN IDENTITY CARD . MOST OF THEM ARE INDIVIDUAL WHO FIND THEIR WAY TO BELGIUM VIA BRITISH TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT AGENCY SPECIALIZED IN AIR TRANSPORT . ACCORDING TO THE PILOT ' ASSOCIATION , THE PAYMENT OF SOCIAL SECURITY CONTRIBUTION AND TAX ARE BEING AVOIDED , BECAUSE IF THEY ARE BEING PAID ANYWHERE , IT IS CERTAINLY NOT IN BELGIUM . FOR EXAMPLE , PORTUGUESE PILOT HAVE ADDRESS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM WHERE THEY NEVER STAY . THE PILOT ' ASSOCIATION WENT TO THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR 'S OFFICE WITH IT FINDING 18 MONTH AGO . THE INVESTIGATION BEING CONDUCTED BY THE LABOR INSPECTORATE LED TO A WHOLE SERIES OF PROTOCOL AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF INFRINGEMENT , BUT SO FAR NO CASE HAVE FOUND THEIR WAY TO COURT . INCIDENTALLY , EAT IS BY FAR FROM THE ONLY AIRLINE EMPLOYING LARGE NUMBER OF FOREIGNER . VIRGIN ALSO DOE SO , FOR EXAMPLE . HOWEVER , IT IS NOT JUST HERE THAT THE SHOE PINCH . VARIOUS SOURCE HAVE CONFIRMED TO U THAT THESE FOREIGNER DO VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING DEMANDED OF THEM BY EAT , BEARING IN MIND THEIR WEAK SOCIAL POSITION . ONE EAT PILOT CAME TO THE STAGGERING CONCLUSION THAT SOME CANADIAN HAD WORKED 28 NIGHT IN SUCCESSION , WHICH VIOLATES ALL THE RULE . THEY DO THIS SO THAT THEY CAN SUBSEQUENTLY ENJOY A FEW WEEK ' BREAK IN CANADA . ADMITTEDLY EAT HA BEEN GRANTED PERMISSION BY THE BELGIAN CIVIL AVIATION AUTHORITY TO ALLOW IT PERSONNEL TO WORK A BIT LONGER THAN THE NORMAL RULE OF EIGHT DAY ' FLYING , SIX DAY ' REST , BUT THE AUTHORITY ATTACHED A WHOLE SERIES OF CONDITION TO THIS AND DEFINITELY DOE NOT PERMIT 28 DAY OF UNINTERRUPTED SERVICE .

HIS CONCERN ABOUT THE DUTY TIME PROF THIS . HE ONLY TOOK STEP AFTER HAVING FLOWN ON SEVERAL OCCASION WITH COPILOT WHO WERE OVERTIRED . '' THE PILOT ' ASSOCIATION HA ALSO RECEIVED A WHOLE STACK OF COMPLAINT ABOUT SUB-STANDARD MAINTENANCE AND FLIGHT SAFETY AT EAT . FOR EXAMPLE , SOME TECHNICIAN HAVE ADMITTED THAT THEY RECEIVE BONUS DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH MONEY IS NOT SPENT DURING MAINTENANCE . SOME PILOT HAVE REPORTED THAT THEY WERE FORCED TO FLY THEIR MACHINE TO ZAVENTEM EVEN AFTER A TECHNICAL FAULT HAD BEEN DETECTED , EVEN WHEN THE AIRCRAFT DID NOT MEET THE REQUIRED MINIMUM EQUIPMENT LIST . MEANWHILE , IN THE TECHNICAL REPORT ( CALLED TROUBLE REPORT ) , SOME DEFECT ARE LISTED FOR SEVERAL SUCCESSIVE DAY , WITH A TECHNICIAN WRITING IN EACH CASE THAT THE PROBLEM HA BEEN RESOLVED . PILOT CONFIRM THAT THE MANDATORY DAILY INSPECTION BY A TECHNICIAN IS OFTEN LIMITED TO SIGNING THE LOG BOOK . THIS IS REFERRED TO A `` A DAILY EAT . '' EAT , BY THE WAY , HA 20 AIRCRAFT OF IT OWN AND CHARTER AROUND 40 MORE -- PLUS CREW MEMBER -- FROM OTHER AIRLINE , INCLUDING U COMPANY . WHILE THESE AIRCRAFT OPERATE OUT OF BELGIUM , THEY DO NOT FALL UNDER THE STRICT BELGIAN LEGISLATION AND ARE THEREFORE VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO MONITOR . AGALEV [ FLEMISH ECOLOGY PARTY ] DEPUTY LODE VAN OOST , WHO HA PUT QUESTION TO TRANSPORT MINISTER MICHEL DAERDEN ON SEVERAL OCCASION WITH REGARD TO EAT , IS REGULARLY TOLD THAT THE AUTHORITY HA NOT DETECTED ANY VIOLATION . `` I ASK MYSELF HOW THAT CAN POSSIBLY BE THE CASE , '' VAN OOST SAID . HOWEVER , AFTER YET ANOTHER QUESTION ALONG SIMILAR LINE WA ASKED LAST WEEK , THE AUTHORITY HA SUPPOSEDLY NOW LAUNCHED AN INVESTIGATION AFTER ALL , WHICH -- ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCE -- HA UNCOVERED ALL KIND OF IRREGULARITY . THE PILOT ' ASSOCIATION ALSO RECENTLY WENT TO THE AUTHORITY TO TALK ABOUT THE PROBLEM AT EAT . `` WE HAVE NOTHING WHATSOEVER AGAINST THE COMPANY , BUT WE ARE OF THE OPINION THAT IT MUST ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RULE , '' THE ASSOCIATION 'S PRESIDENT , JEAN DE LOOZE , SAID . WHEN ASKED FOR HIS REACTION YESTERDAY EVENING [ 29 JUNE ] , EAT 'S DIRECTOR OF OPERATION , IWEIN VAN CAELENBERG SAID THAT HE KNEW THERE WERE PROBLEM WITH THE DUTY TIME AND THAT THESE ARE CURRENTLY UNDER REVIEW . `` SO WE ARE WORKING ON IT . '' HE POINTED OUT THAT EAT HA NO OPTION BUT TO TAKE FOREIGN PILOT INTO SERVICE BECAUSE THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF PILOT IN BELGIUM . ACCORDING TO VAN CAELENBERG , THE LEGISLATION HERE IS NOT AT ALL SUITABLE FOR DEALING WITH THIS `` IRREVERSIBLE SITUATION . '' HE ADMITS THAT THE PILOT SIGNED A PETITION EN MASSE , `` BUT THE QUESTION WERE PUT SO SUGGESTIVELY THAT THEY COULD NOT HELP BUT SIGN IT .

LASTLY , THE MECHANIC SLIP HIS FRIEND THE WAREHOUSEMAN A `` LITTLE SOMETHING FOR HIS TROUBLE . '' IT MAY EVEN HAPPEN THAT IT IS THE OWNER OF THE CAR , MAYBE TO MAKE SOMETHING ON THE INSURANCE , WHO GET HIS MECHANIC TO APPLY TO THE DEMOLITION DEALER . OUR STORY IS ABOUT AIRCRAFT , AND THE SAFETY AND LIFE OF HUNDRED OF PASSENGER WHO FLY EVERY DAY ON PLANE THAT MIGHT DEVELOP FAILURE AND FAULT CAUSED BY WORN-OUT SPARE PART ARE AT STAKE . `` SAFE WING , '' THE TEMPIO PAUSANIA [ SARDINIA ] PUBLIC PROSECUTOR 'S OFFICE INVESTIGATION , HA REVEALED THIS ALARMING SITUATION : THE MARKET IN SPARE PART AND ELECTRONIC FLIGHT INSTRUMENT . HOWEVER , REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE INVESTIGATION MANAGES TO PROVE IN TERM OF CRIMINAL LIABILITY , IT IS ALREADY CLEAR -- A THE ENAC [ NATIONAL CIVIL AVIATION BOARD ] INITIATIVE SHOW -- THAT THE SARDINIAN INVESTIGATOR ' WORK HA LIFTED THE LID ON A TRADE THAT HA BEEN GOING ON FOR YEAR . IT WA THE NIGHT OF 25 APRIL 1999 WHEN SIX BANDIT ARMED WITH HAD GRENADE AND KALASHNIKOV BROKE INTO THE OLBIA AIRPORT MAINTENANCE HANGAR AND STOLE SPARE PART . SETTING OFF FROM THAT ROBBERY , TEMPIO PAUSANIA 'S DEPUTY PUBLIC PROSECUTOR , RENATO PERINU , CAME ACROSS AN ILLEGAL TRADE IN AVIONIC EQUIPMENT OBTAINED CHIEFLY FROM THE DISMANTLING OF DAMAGED OR DECOMMISSIONED AIRCRAFT . FOR THE SUSPECT ' DEFENSE LAWYER , OF COURSE , IT WA A NORMAL SPARE PART BUSINESS . THE OFFENCE WITH WHICH THE SUSPECT HAVE BEEN CHARGED BY TEMPIO PAUSANIA GIP [ JUDGE OF THE PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION -- WHO ASS WHETHER THE DEFENDANT HAVE A CASE TO ANSWER ON THE STRENGTH OF THE EVIDENCE ] PAOLO PONASSI REVEAL AN INITIAL MAP OF THE AIRLINE AND COMPANY INVOLVED IN THE TRAFFICKING , WHICH HAVE PURCHASED SPARE PART AND FLIGHT INSTRUMENT FROM COMPANY BY THE NAME OF `` NEWTECH ITALIA SRL [ LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY ] , '' `` NEWTECH AEROSPACE '' ( WHOSE MANAGING DIRECTOR , GINO BOSELLI , IS UNDER INVESTIGATION ) , AND `` PANAVIATION SPA [ JOINT-STOCK COMPANY ] '' ( WHOSE MANAGING DIRECTOR , ENZO FREGONESE , IS UNDER INVESTIGATION ) . THE INVESTIGATOR ARE ATTEMPTING TO ESTABLISH THE ROLE PLAYED BY MERIDIANA [ ITALIAN AIRLINE ] TOO IN THE DISCARDING AND SALE OF EQUIPMENT . BE THAT A IT MAY , ACCORDING TO THE INVESTIGATOR ' FINDING TO DATE , THE COMPANY CONCERNED HAVE SOLD THEIR WARE TO VARIOUS ITALIAN AIRLINE AND U AND CANADIAN COMPANY : MERIDIANA , AIR ONE , AIR DOLOMITI , ALPI EAGLE , AIR SICILIA , AZZURRA , MINERCA , AND VOLARE , TO NAME BUT THE ITALIAN COMPANY . THEN THERE ARE THE FOREIGN PURCHASER : AIR STOCK INC AND IUNC INC. , DANBEE-MITCHELL , AVIATION SALE COMPANY , FLIGHT DIRECTOR INC. , INTERNATIONAL AIRLINE SUPPORT GROUP , AND CANADA 'S POLE AIR2 . THE CHARGE MADE AGAINST THE SUSPECT LARGELY INVOLVE THREE OFFENCE : COUNTERFEITING DOCUMENT , POSING A THREAT TO PUBLIC AIR TRANSPORT SAFETY , AND EXTORTION , ALTHOUGH THE LATTER CHARGE CONCERN ONLY ONE OF THE SUSPECT . IT IS THE MOST SERIOUS CRIME , WHICH ALLOWS THE INVESTIGATION TO REMAIN , FOR THE TIME BEING AT LEAST , IN TEMPIO PAUSANIA INSTEAD OF BEING TRANSFERRED TO ROME . THE EPISODE STATED IN THE COURT ORDER INVOLVE PAOLO PIETRO CORRIAS , A MERIDIANA SPA EMPLOYEE , WHO IS CHARGED WITH OBTAINING 7 PERCENT OF THE SUM INVOICED ( OVER 31,500 EURO IN ALL ) FOR SUPPLY OF AIRCRAFT PART BOUND FOR MERIDIANA FROM NEWTECH ITALIA AND NEWTECH AEROSPACE MANAGING DIRECTOR GINO BOSELLI . CORRIAS IS ALSO CHARGED WITH OBTAINING THE SAME 7 PERCENT ( OVER 7,700 EURO ) FROM U COMPANY MITCHELL AIR KRAFT 'S REPRESENTATIVE IN ITALY , GEORGE SCHUSTER FOR GUARANTEEING THE SUPPLY OF AIRCRAFT PART BOUND FOR MERIDIANA . IT ALSO HA TO BE SAID , HOWEVER , THAT GIP PONASSI HERSELF STATE THAT `` THERE IS NO GRAVE EVIDENCE '' OF CORRIAS `` BEING GUILTY OF THE CRIME OF EXTORTION . '' TO DATE , THE FINANCE POLICE INVESTIGATOR HAVE MANAGED TO ASCERTAIN THE ORIGIN OF A TINY PROPORTION OF THE MATERIAL SOLD : PART OF THE CANADAIR C1-215 THAT CRASHED IN SICILY IN 1996 , EQUIPMENT ( A FUEL LEVEL INDICATOR ) DISCARDED BY THE EX-ADRIA AIRWAY ( FORMER YUGOSLAVIA ) , AIRCRAFT PART ( FROM THE CANADAIR ) OBTAINED FROM MONTALTO BROTHER OF PALERMO ( WHO SPECIALIZE IN DEMOLISHING WRITTEN-OFF CAR ) , AND PART BOUGHT FROM THE FORMER ITAVIA . THE INVESTIGATION BY THE SARDINIAN JUDICIARY WOULD APPEAR TO CHALLENGE THE VERY ROOT OF THIS TRADE , THE MARKET IN SPARE PART , INSTRUMENT , AND PART ALREADY USED AND , CONSEQUENTLY , CONSIDERING THE CHARGE OF `` POSING A THREAT TO PUBLIC AIR TRANSPORT SAFETY , '' ALREADY WORN OUT AND IN ANY CASE NOT ADEQUATELY INSPECTED . THE SUSPECT ' LAWYER WILL , OF COURSE , PUT UP A FIGHT IN THE TEMPIO PAUSANIA COURT ROOM , DISPUTING THE VERY PREMISE OF THE INVESTIGATION , WHICH LAY THE BLAME FOR JEOPARDIZING FLIGHT SAFETY ON THE GO-BETWEEN AND SELLER , WHEREAS , THE DEFENSE CLAIM , IT WA UP TO THE PURCHASER , THE AIRLINE , TO CHECK THAT THE EQUIPMENT WA UP TO STANDARD . THE KEY DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE THAT , ACCORDING TO THE PROSECUTION , NAIL THE SUSPECT IS THE `` COUNTERFEITING OF JAA FORM ONE CERTIFICATE , '' `` WHICH ENABLED THEM TO SELL AIRCRAFT PART FALSELY CERTIFIED A NEW TO VARIOUS AIRLINE .

'' THE BUYER , IN OTHER WORD . THERE ARE , HOWEVER , A NUMBER OF DOCUMENTED EPISODE FROM WHICH FAR MORE ELEMENTARY FORM OF COUNTERFEITING EMERGE , A THE GIP 'S ORDER POINT OUT IN CONNECTION WITH THE PANAVIATION WAREHOUSE AT CIAMPINO [ ROME AIRPORT ] : `` THERE IS NO DENYING THE ALARMING FACT THAT THE USE OF COUNTERFEIT DOCUMENTATION MADE IT POSSIBLE TO SELL PART OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN . A TYPICAL INSTANCE IS THE FINDING , IN THE CIAMPINO HANGAR , OF A NUMBER OF COMPRESSOR DISK FROM THE IBERIA AIRLINE , ON WHICH THE LABEL READING RETIRADO , MEANING WITHDRAWN , HAD BEEN REPLACED WITH ANOTHER READING O/H ( STANDING FOR OVERHAULED ) , THUS MAKING IT LOOK A IF THE PART HAD BEEN CERTIFIED IN GOOD WORKING ORDER BY THE AIRLINE ITSELF , WHEREAS IT HAD ACTUALLY DECLARED THEM UNUSABLE . '' HOWEVER , THE GIP STATE IN HER ORDER THAT SHE `` DEEMS THE NATURE OF THE FORGED QUALITY ASSURANCE CERTIFICATE MADE OUT BY THE SUSPECT TO BE ON A PAR WITH THAT OF [ FORGED ] ADMINISTRATIVE CERTIFICATE .

      " EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AGRICULTURE COMMISSION PRESIDENT ON HOOF AND MOUTH CRISIS STRASBOURG - `` WITHOUT WANTING TO CULTIVATE CYNICISM , IT IS NOT THE WORST EVIL THAT THE HOOF AND MOUTH DISEASE CRISIS HA OCCURRED AT THIS MOMENT : AFTER MAD COW DISEASE , IT WILL FORCE U TO CONSIDER AN IN-DEPTH REFORM OF THE COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY ( CAP ) , '' ACCORDING TO FRIEDRICH WILHELM GRAEFE ZU BARINGDORF , PRESIDENT OF THE AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT . GRAEFE ZU BARINGDORF SAID BLUNTLY WHAT MANY PEOPLE IN EUROPE ARE THINKING AT THE MOMENT : THAT THE HOOF AND MOUTH DISEASE EPIZOOTIC HA GIVEN THE COUP DE GRACE TO THE 1962-VERSION OF THE CAP ( 1962 WA THE YEAR THE CAP WA ESTABLISHED ) . PRIMACY OF THE MARKET FOR THIS GERMAN GREEN AGED 58 , BOTH THE ORIGIN OF BSE ( BOVINE SPONGIFORM ENCEPHALOPATHY ) AND HOOF AND MOUTH DISEASE LIE IN THE PRODUCTIVISM OF THE CAP . `` IT IS THE EUROPEAN INDUSTRIAL MODE OF PRODUCTION , WHICH IS AFFECTED , '' SAID GRAEFE ZU BARINGDORF , AN MEP ( MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ) , WHO IS ALSO A FARMER IN WESTPHALIA . ACCORDING TO GRAEFE ZU BARINGDORF , THERE IS NO `` BRITISH CURSE , '' DESPITE THE FACT THAT BSE AND HOOF AND MOUTH DISEASE HAVE HIT THIS COUNTRY WITH FULL FORCE . `` THE UNITED KINGDOM HA IN A WAY BEEN CHOSEN BY DESTINY TO SHOW TO ALL OF EUROPE HOW YOU SHOULD NOT RUN AGRICULTURE , '' HE SAID . THE PRIMACY OF THE MARKET HA LED TO THE STATE ABDICATING IT POWER . `` IN BOTH CASE , THE UK ADMINISTRATION DID NOT SHOW ENOUGH VIGILANCE , AND WA LATE IN ACTING , '' GRAEFE ZU BARINGDORF SAID . `` IN THE CASE OF BSE , IT CONTINUED TO EXPORT IT CONTAMINATED ANIMAL FEED TO THE CONTINENT UNTIL 1996. IN THE CASE OF HOOF AND MOUTH DISEASE , IT ALLOWED ANIMAL ALREADY AFFECTED BY THE DISEASE TO BE EXPORTED . '' SPEAKING BEFORE THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT YESTERDAY , EUROPEAN COMMISSIONER FOR HEALTH DAVID BYRNE CONFIRMED THAT IT WA THE IMPORT OF CONTAMINATED SHEEP ON 16 FEBRUARY , WHICH IS THE ORIGIN OF THE DISEASE IN FRANCE . ACCORDING TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT 'S AGRICULTURE COMMISSION , `` THE RE-NATIONALIZATION OF AGRICULTURAL POLICY '' WOULD NOT CHANGE ANYTHING , BECAUSE TRADE IS A NECESSITY , SINCE THE EUROPEAN COUNTRY ARE UNABLE TO ASPIRE TO SELF-SUFFICIENCY IN FOOD . IN ADDITION , `` RE-NATIONALIZATION WOULD NOT AN ADAPTED RESPONSE : THE VIGILANCE OF THE PUBLIC AUTHORITY MUST EXIST INSIDE EACH STATE , '' GRAEFE ZU BARINGDORF SAID . `` BUT CLEARLY IN THESE TWO CASE , THIS IS WHAT WA LACKING . '' BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT THE PURSUIT OF PROFIT REGARDLESS OF THE COST HA HAD IT DAY . `` IT IS NECESSARY TO SAY FAREWELL TO THE IDEA OF HAVING A MARKET WITHOUT RULE , '' GRAEFE ZU BARINGDORF SAID . THE GREEN ARE NOT ALONE IN THINKING THAT THE CAP MUST BE RE-ORIENTATED TOWARD EXTENSIVE AGRICULTURE , WHICH IS RESPECTFUL OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND HEALTH , AND ATTENTIVE TO QUALITY . THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION IS ON THE SAME WAVELENGTH , A ARE GERMANY OR ITALY ( IT IS NO COINCIDENCE THAT THESE TWO COUNTRY HAVE APPOINTED ECOLOGIST TO BE THEIR AGRICULTURE MINISTER ) . EVEN FRANCE , THE ARCHITECT OF THE CURRENT CAP , IS STARTING TO MOVE : ONLY FRENCH PRESIDENT JACQUES CHIRAC IS STILL SHOWING ANY RESISTANCE TO AN IN-DEPTH REFORM . RECENTLY CHIRAC GAVE A REMINDER THAT THE REFORM OF THE CAP `` IS NOT ON THE AGENDA . '' THE PRESIDENT HA NOT FORGOTTEN THAT IT WA HIMSELF , WHO WA BEHIND THE PRODUCTIVIST AND PRO-MARKET CHOICE OF EUROPEAN AGRICULTURE , WHEN HE WA THE AGRICULTURE MINISTER UNDER PRESIDENT POMPIDOU . QUITE OBVIOUSLY , ONLY A FRANCO-GERMAN INITIATIVE COULD GET A REFORM MOVING , STRESSED GRAEFE ZU BARINGDORF . HEALTH CONTROL ALTHOUGH HIGH-QUALITY AGRICULTURE IS NECESSARY , IT IS NECESSARY TO GO FURTHER IN BRINGING THE FREE MARKET INTO QUESTION . HEALTH CONTROL MUST BE RE-THOUGHT . `` THE EUROPEAN SYSTEM IS INADEQUATE : IT IS NOT NORMAL THAT FRANCE IS UNABLE TO CHECK UK FOODSTUFF , '' IN THE NAME OF THE FREE MOVEMENT OF GOOD , GRAEFE ZU BARINGDORF SAID . `` CLEARLY THERE IS A DANGER IN TRUSTING THE CHECK OF EXPORTING COUNTRY , WHICH COULD BE INFLUENCED BY ECONOMIC CONSIDERATION . '' ACCORDING TO GRAEFE ZU BARINGDORF , IT IS NECESSARY TO INSTITUTE CONTROL IN IMPORTING COUNTRY , WHICH WILL BE ORIENTATED MORE TOWARD THE HEALTH OF CONSUMER . EMERGENCY SIMILARLY , IT IS NECESSARY TO BE ABLE TO TRACE SHIPMENT OF ALL AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT . `` VIGILANCE MUST EXIST IN 'PEACE TIME , ' '' SAID GRAEFE ZU BARINGDORF . `` PEOPLE HAVE THE FEELING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION DO NOT DO ANYTHING , EXCEPT IN THE EVENT OF A CRISIS . AND IN THAT CASE , EMBARGO ARE DECIDED A A MATTER OF URGENCY . STATE SHOULD BE IN A PERMANENT STATE OF EMERGENCY . ''\n",

      " IMPACT OF HOOF AND MOUTH EPIDEMIC ON FRANCO-GERMAN RELATION VIEWED THE OUTBREAK OF HOOF AND MOUTH DISEASE IN FRANCE CREATED A STRANGE BACKDROP FOR THE MEETING OF FRENCH AND GERMAN FOREIGN AND AGRICULTURE MINISTER IN PARIS ON THE EVENING OF TUESDAY 13 MARCH , TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE OVER EUROPEAN AGRICULTURE POLICY THAT HA EXISTED BETWEEN THEIR TWO COUNTRY SINCE THE BERLIN SUMMIT OF MARCH 1999. WITH THE CRISIS PERHAPS HELPING TO RESTORE A LEVEL-HEADED APPROACH , IT WA ACKNOWLEDGED THAT , DESPITE THE HARSH LANGUAGE OF RECENT MONTH CONCERNING THE COST AND CAUSE OF THE CRISIS , THERE WERE POSSIBLE POINT OF RAPPROCHEMENT ACCORDING TO DIPLOMATIC SOURCE , THE FEELING , FOLLOWING THE DINNER AT THE QUAI D'ORSAY [ FOREIGN MINISTRY ] , WA THAT THE CONVERGENCE WERE `` STRONGER THAN EXPECTED . '' DISCUSSION WILL CONTINUE ON `` IDENTIFYING THE PROBLEM AND CHALLENGE TO BE MET IN ORDER TO BUILD A QUALITY AGRICULTURE , TAKING ACCOUNT OF THE IMPERATIVE OF FOOD SAFETY , USING IN THE IMMEDIATE TERM THE FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT PERMITTED BY THE BERLIN AGREEMENT . '' THIS UNUSUAL MEETING , WHICH BROUGHT TOGETHER TWO OF LIONEL JOSPIN 'S MINISTER , HUBERT VEDRINE AND JEAN GLAVANY , AND THE TWO LEADING GERMAN GREEN REPRESENTATIVE WITHIN THE SCHROEDER TEAM , JOSCHKA FISCHER AND RENATE KUENST , WA SET WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE TWO CAPITAL ' CURRENT EFFORT TO TRY TO RESTORE LE UNEASY RELATION BY RESOLVING TOPIC OF FRICTION . THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL MEETING SINCE JANUARY , FOLLOWING THE CRISIS SPARKED BY THE NICE SUMMIT . PRESIDENT CHIRAC , THE PRIME MINISTER , AND CHANCELLOR SCHROEDER WILL BE MEETING IN HERXHEIM 20 MARCH IN ORDER TO REVIEW THE EXPLORATORY WORK THAT THEY HAVE ENTRUSTED TO THEIR FOREIGN MINISTER . THE CRISIS EXPERIENCED BY STOCK FARMING , A REAL CHALLENGE TO THE EU 'S COHESION , HA REVIVED SUSPICION . CONFRONTED WITH THE SCALE OF THE REPERCUSSION ON THE RURAL FABRIC , FRANCE WANTED MORE AID , WHEREAS GERMANY HA REJECTED THE RATIONALE OF ENDLESS SUBSIDY . THE OUTBREAK OF HOOF AND MOUTH DISEASE HA EXACERBATED THE CLIMATE , ALL GOVERNMENT BEING OBLIGED TO STEP UP PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE . HAVING TRIED TO CONFINE THE VIRUS TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHANNEL , FRANCE IN TURN IS NOW IN QUARANTINE . SEVERAL GERMAN LAENDER HAVE ANNOUNCED THE DESTRUCTION OF ANIMAL THAT HAVE ARRIVED IN RECENT WEEK FROM FRENCH AREA AT RISK AND HAVE URGED THEIR CITIZEN TO LIMIT TRAVEL TO FRANCE . REALIZATION [ SUBHEAD ] PARADOXICALLY , HOWEVER , THE FIRST CASE OF MAD COW 'S DISEASE TO APPEAR IN GERMANY , LAST FALL , CREATED A MORE FAVORABLE SITUATION FOR DIALOGUE . HAVING BEEN TASKED IN JANUARY WITH REAPPRAISING GERMANY 'S AGRICULTURAL POLICY , THE NEW AGRICULTURE MINISTER PROMPTLY CALLED FOR A RADIAL CHANGE OF COURSE . `` QUALITY RATHER THAN MASS PRODUCTION , '' WA THE WATCHWORD REAFFIRMED THIS WEEKEND BY THE GERMAN GREEN ' CONGRESS IN STUTTGART . THIS TURNABOUT , WHICH IS CAUSING ANXIETY WITHIN THE PROFESSION , ESPECIALLY IN FRANCE , NEVERTHELESS REFLECTS THE REALIZATION IN GERMANY BOTH THAT FARMING IS NOT JUST A MATTER FOR FARMER AND ALSO THAT , EVEN WITHIN OUR URBAN SOCIETY , IT EXTENDS TO MORE A MORE COMPLEX RANGE OF FACTOR . FRANCE 'S SOCIALIST GOVERNMENT , WHICH HA WORKED SINCE IT ACCESSION TO POWER TO PROMOTE AGRICULTURE MORE RESPECTFUL OF IT ENVIRONMENT , BY OFFERING FARMER NEW LAND USE CONTRACT , IS READY TO TAKE THE GERMAN AT THEIR WORD . IT WA EASY FOR FRENCH AGRICULTURE MINISTER TO POINT OUT , IN AN INTERVIEW PUBLISHED BY LE ECHO 8 MARCH , THAT GERMANY ALSO OPPOSED A MODIFICATION OF AID FOR QUALITY AGRICULTURE , AND HA NOT HITHERTO USED THE OPPORTUNITY OPENED UP IN THIS DIRECTION BY THE BERLIN AGREEMENT . ANTICIPATING THE GERMAN GREEN ' CONGRESS , HE ARGUED THE NEED FOR FARMER TO `` REACH A NEW CONTRACT WITH SOCIETY TO MOVE ON FROM PRODUCING MORE TO PRODUCING BETTER . '' HE SAID THAT WHEN THE TIME FOR THE REVIEW OF CAP COME IN 2003 , `` IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO BE ABLE TO ISSUE STRONG POLITICAL SIGNAL , SHOWING THAT WE HAVE LEARNED OUR LESSON FROM THE CRISIS AND RECEIVED THE MESSAGE FROM THE PUBLIC .

      " FRANCE 'S GLAVANY CITED ON BSE , HOOF AND MOUTH MEASURE [ LE FIGARO ] ACCORDING TO THE LATEST AFSSA [ FRENCH FOOD HEALTH SAFETY AGENCY ] FINDING , NONE OF THE SUSPECTED AREA , APART FROM MAYENNE , HA PROVED TO HAVE BEEN CONTAMINATED BY HOOF AND MOUTH DISEASE . CAN WE CONSIDER FRANCE TO HAVE EXTRICATED ITSELF FROM THE CRISIS ? [ GLAVANY ] I WISH THIS WERE SO ! OUR CONFIDENCE INCREASE WITH EVERY PASSING DAY , BUT IT IS TO EARLY TO PROCLAIM VICTORY . THE PHENOMENON IS FAR FROM HAVING BEEN BROUGHT UNDER CONTROL IN THE UK : THE AUTHORITY ARE PURSUING IT INTENSIVELY . WITH SO MANY NEW OUTBREAK DAILY THERE -- THAT IS , ON OUR DOORSTEP -- THERE IS A GREAT RISK ; THE WIND OR THE THOUSAND OF TOURIST AND TRUCK CROSSING THE CHANNEL EVERY DAY COULD BRING THE VIRUS IN . [ LE FIGARO ] BUT HA THE BATTLE BEEN WON A REGARD THE RISK OF DIRECT CONTAMINATION BY SHEEP IMPORTED FROM THE UK BETWEEN 1 AND 21 FEBRUARY ? [ GLAVANY ] LET U SAY THAT IT IS ON THE WAY TO BEING SO . THIS IS WHY I HAVE ASKED EUROPE TO LIGHTEN THE RESTRICTIVE MEASURE THAT IT IMPOSED ON U A SOON A POSSIBLE , ON THE BASIS OF THE PROVISION THAT FRANCE HA ADOPTED . A A PRECAUTION , WE HAVE SLAUGHTERED 40,000 BRITISH SHEEP OR SHEEP THAT WERE IN CONTACT WITH BRITISH SHEEP , AND WE HAVE INTRODUCED SAFETY BOUNDARY . FRANCE HA DECIDED TO HIT HARD AND FAST , AND WE ARE NOW SEEING THAT THIS IS WHAT HAD TO BE DONE . I WOULD FEEL MORE REASSURED IF OUR NEIGHBOR HAD DONE THEE SAME . [ LE FIGARO ] WHAT DO YOU MEAN ? [ GLAVANY ] I AM NOT SURE THAT EVERYONE HA MONITORED BRITISH IMPORT A WE HAVE . ONE OF THE LESSON OF THIS CRISIS IS , IN PASSING , THAT EUROPE MUST MAKE PROGRESS WITH REGARD TO TRACEABILITY OF SHEEP . THE BRITISH SAY THAT WE ARE NOT THE ONLY ONE TO WHOM THEY SUPPLIED SHEEP DURING THE CRITICAL PERIOD . I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT PROTECTIVE OR PREVENTIVE SLAUGHTER MEASURE ELSEWHERE , EXPECT IN THE NETHERLANDS . [ LE FIGARO ] ARE YOU SAYING THIS BECAUSE EUROPE HA NOT BEEN KIND TO FRANCE ? [ GLAVANY ] THE EUROPEAN INSTITUTION HAVE FUNCTIONED WELL . IT IS , RATHER , OUTSIDE THE EU THAT THERE HA BEEN A HASTINESS TO DO MORE THAN NECESSARY AND TO CONFUSE MERCENARY CONSIDERATION WITH THE PRECAUTION PRINCIPLE . BUT , COMPARED TO OUR NEIGHBOR , IT IS TRUE THAT IT IS BETTER NOT TO GO DOWN ON YOUR KNEE : IT BEING THE FOREMOST AGRICULTURAL AND ANIMAL FARMING POWER , FRANCE WILL EVIDENTLY NOT BE EXCUSED ANY WEAKNESS ... [ LE FIGARO ] FRANCOIS D'AUBERT , DEPUTY FOR MAYENNE , WANT TO APPEAL TO THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE , SINCE HE CONSIDERS THE EMBARGO ON ORNE AND MAYENNE ILLEGAL . WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ? [ GLAVANY ] I DO NOT ENCOURAGE FRANCOIS D'AUBERT TO ATTACK THE EUROPEAN DECISION . EUROPE CAN NOT BE CRITICIZED FOR DOING IT JOB . SOME COUNTRY WANTED TO HAVE U SUBJECTED TO A BLOCKADE AFFECTING THE WHOLE OF OUR TERRITORY . WE SUCCEEDED IN CONFINING IT TO THESE TWO DEPARTMENT , WHICH SERVED A OUR HEALTH SHIELD . IN VIEW OF THE SACRIFICE THAT IS BEING DEMANDED OF THEM , THEY MUST ENJOY THE NATION 'S SUPPORT . [ LE FIGARO ] DESPITE ALL THE MEASURE ADOPTED TO LIMIT THE SPREAD OF THE ILLNESS , FRENCH PEOPLE REMAIN SKEPTICAL , AND THE CONSUMPTION OF LAMB HA FALLEN BY ALMOST 30 PERCENT DURING THE PAST MONTH ... [ GLAVANY ] THIS IS CRITICAL , PARTICULARLY SINCE THIS ILLNESS IS NOT DANGEROUS TO HUMAN BEING . THE MESSAGE THAT WE ARE DRIVING HOME , HEALTH MINISTER BERNARD KOUCHNER AND I , IS CLEAR , HOWEVER . THIS IS INDEED AN ANIMAL HEALTH PROBLEM , NOT A PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM . THERE IS NO REASON FOR THIS DROP IN CONSUMPTION . BUT IT IS TRUE THAT THE SUCCESSION OF CRISIS , BSE AND THEN HOOF AND MOUTH DISEASE , IS CAUSING REFLEX RESPONSE AMONG THE PUBLIC . THE PICTURE OF SLAUGHTER HOUSE AND PYRE SHOWN ON TELEVISION OVER THE PAST MONTH HAVE PLAYED A FRIGHTENING ROLE AND EXPLAIN THIS REJECTION . WE REALLY MUST ABANDON THIS DISASTROUS PSYCHOSIS A SOON A POSSIBLE , BECAUSE IT IS HAVING A DOMINO EFFECT : I HAVE EVEN BEEN TOLD THAT RESERVATION AT RURAL HOLIDAY CAMP IN MAYENNE HAVE BEEN CANCELED ! [ LE FIGARO ] THE MAIN VICTIM ARE THE FARMER . DO YOU UNDERSTAND THEIR DISTRESS ? [ GLAVANY ] OF COURSE ANY SECTOR OF SOCIETY THAT WERE TO EXPERIENCE WHAT THEY ARE EXPERIENCING WOULD ASK QUESTION ABOUT THEIR PURPOSE AND THEIR FUTURE . THEY ARE AT THE END OF THEIR TETHER , BUT WHO WOULD NOT BE SO ? THIS IS WHY THEY MUST BE GIVEN NOT ONLY FINANCIAL , BUT ALSO MORAL SUPPORT . THEY ARE SUFFERING THE EFFECT OF TWO CRISIS . CONSUMPTION HA FALLEN BY 50 PERCENT AND EXPORT BY 980 PERCENT . IN THE CASE OF HOOD AND MOUTH DISEASE , WE MUST BE BRAVE ENOUGH TO RESOLUTELY PURSUE THE MEASURE THAT WE HAVE ADOPTED . THIS WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO LIFT THEM A SOON A POSSIBLE . IN THE CASE OF BSE , WE MUST ACCELERATE AND INCREASE ECONOMIC SUPPORT TO THE SECTOR . I AM WORRIED TO SEE THAT VERY FEW COUNTRY IN EUROPE ARE IMPLEMENTING THE PROGRAM FOR THE PURCHASE AND DESTRUCTION OF CATTLE OVER 30 MONTH OLD DECIDED ON 2 JANUARY . WE HAVE CONSIDERABLE SURPLUS . HUNDRED OF THOUSAND OF HEAD OF CATTLE NEED TO BE SLAUGHTERED IN EUROPE , INCLUDING YOUNG HEIFER , IN ORDER TO RESTORE A BALANCE BETWEEN SUPPLY AND DEMAND . THE COUNTRY OF THE NORTH OPPOSE THIS . BUT IF WE NOT DO IT , WE WILL CAUSE THIS CRISIS TO DRAG ON FOR MONTH AND MONTH . [ LE FIGARO ] WE ARE CLINGING TO THE RATIONALE OF AN AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY ON A DRIP . SHOULD CAP [ COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY ] NOT BE CALLED INTO QUESTION ? [ GLAVANY ] I ADMIT THAT THE INDUSTRY 'S ECONOMIC DEPENDENCY IS HARD TO ACCEPT , BOTH FOR THE PUBLIC AND FOR FARMER THEMSELVES . BUT I DO NOT WANT TO ENVISAGE A NON-SUBSIDIZED EUROPEAN POLICY , BECAUSE THAT WOULD REDUCE THE NUMBER OF FARMER FROM 680,000 TO 150,000 , WITH ALL THE REPERCUSSION THAT THIS WOULD HAVE ON LAND MANAGEMENT AND THE BALANCE OF SOCIETY . HOWEVER , I DO THINK THAT SUBSIDY ARE BADLY ALLOCATED AND THAT CAP MUST BE REORIENTED . BUT THIS IS A SEPARATE DEBATE , AND IT IS NOT TOPICAL AT A TIME OF CRISIS .\n",

HONGKONG BANK GENERAL MANAGER CHRIS LANGLEY SAID : `` THE INCREASE IS A REFLECTION OF THE CONTINUAL CHANGE OF THE AVAILABILITY OF FUND FOR PROPERTY LENDING . `` IT IS ALSO A REFLECTION THAT THE VERY LOW RATE SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR HAVE BECOME UNSUSTAINABLE . THE RATE ARE NOW BACK TO A MORE NORMAL LEVEL . '' DURING THE PRICE WAR , FLAT BUYER COULD OBTAIN A RATE A LOW A 8.75 PER CENT .

FOLLOWING THE DECISION BY THE POPULAR BANK OF MILAN TO LOWER IT RATE TO 5 PERCENT , A SHORT TIME AGO [ PRIME MINISTER ] PRODI , SPEAKING IN BOLOGNA , REAFFIRMED THAT THE TARGET OF 5 PERCENT IS NO ACT OF CHARITY , BUT THE RESULT OF THE SORTING OUT OF ITALY 'S ECONOMY . [ PASSAGE OMITTED ] [ BEGIN RECORDING ] [ PRODI ] I BELIEVE THE NEWS IS GOOD , BECAUSE FOR MONTH AND MONTH NOW I HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT IF WE SORT OUT THE FUNDAMENTAL OF THE ECONOMY , WE COULD HAVE MORTGAGE AT 5 FIVE PERCENT . WE HAVE GOT THERE , AND I THINK THAT NOW WE CAN MOVE ON . IT IS IMPORTANT , BECAUSE NOW YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVE A JOB , NOT A MARVELOUS JOB , BUT A BASIC JOB , CAN BEGIN TO THINK OF BUYING A HOME , A MY GENERATION DID . WITH MORTGAGE AT FIVE PERCENT , ONE CAN START TO PUT SOMETHING ASIDE SO A TO ABLE TO BUY A HOME . OF COURSE , IT IS CLEAR THAT THE POOREST SECTION OF SOCIETY MUST BE PROTECTED IN ANOTHER WAY , AND WE WILL DO THIS . MEANWHILE , THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE LEAP FORWARD . THE BANK WHICH TOOK THIS STEP , THE POPULAR BANK OF MILAN , DID SO HOWEVER NOT OUT OF CHARITY . IT DID SO BECAUSE IT CAN DO IT , GIVEN THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL OF THE ECONOMY ARE HEALTHY . THERE IS CONVERGENCE WITH RATE IN OTHER COUNTRY , AND THUS IT IS ONE OF THE FRUIT OF THE POLICY TO JOIN EUROPE . [ UNIDENTIFIED CORRESPONDENT ] WILL PEOPLE WHO PAY OFF ONE MORTGAGE , SO A TO NEGOTIATE ANOTHER MORTGAGE AT A LOWER RATE , LOSE THEIR TAX BREAK ? [ PRODI ] THESE TERM ARE FOR NEW MORTGAGE , YOU SEE . A I HAVE SAID BEFORE , ALL OF U -- BANK , GOVERNMENT , CONSUMER ' ASSOCIATION -- WILL HAVE TO PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION TO EXISTING MORTGAGE , BECAUSE IT IS CLEAR THAT ONCE A MORTGAGE IS AGREED , IT IS AGREED . BUT , IN THE FACE OF THESE GREAT CHANGE , WE MUST LOOK FOR A SOLUTION FOR EXISTING MORTGAGE TOO . [ END RECORDING ]\n",

SPEAKING DURING QUESTION TIME IN THE LOWER HOUSE , THE PREMIER NAMED HIS GOVERNMENT 'S INVOLVEMENT WITH BANK AND CREDIT INSTITUTION AIMED AT ROLLING BACK MORTGAGE RATE AND SAID THAT TO DATE , HE HA BEEN GREATLY SATISFIED . `` WHEN I TALKED OF THE DREAM OF 5 % , THE RATE WA 14 % AND NOW IT IS 6.25 % . I THINK WE CAN GET THERE IS A FAIRLY SHORT TIME , '' HE AFFIRMED AND SAID HIS `` DREAM '' WA BASED ON POLICY WHICH INCLUDED CURBING INFLATION . AFTER NOTING THAT THE LEVEL OF COST WITHIN THE ITALIAN BANKING SYSTEM IS GREATER THAN THAT ABROAD , HE SAID , `` BUT TODAY BANK HAVE ROOM TO LOWER NEW MORTGAGE RATE BECAUSE OF THE LOW LEVEL REACHED BY INTEREST PAID ON NEW DEPOSIT . `` I THINK THE VIRTUOUS CIRCLE CAN BE CLOSED LIKE THIS . '' HE MENTIONED THE NEED FOR SURVEILLANCE FOR REMOVING SUCH OBSTACLE A LENDING GUARANTEE AND OTHER PROCEDURE SURROUNDING MORTGAGE AND CONCLUDED HIS REMARK BY SAYING , `` THE 5 % MORTGAGE IS A FEATURE OF CIVILIZATION , A WAY FOR WORKER TO HAVE A HOME . '' EARLIER IN THE DAY , CABINET UNDERSECRETARY ENRICO MICHELI SAID THE BANKING SYSTEM MUST ATTAIN GREATER EFFICIENCY WHICH WILL PAVE THE WAY TO GREATER FLEXIBILITY ON MORTGAGE RATE . WITH REFERENCE TO REPORT THAT BANK SAID THEY WOULD BE UNABLE TO MEET THE 5 % RATE GOAL WITHOUT GOVERNMENT SUBSIDY , MICHELI SAID HE COULD RULE OUT `` STATE AID , THOUGH THIS WA DISCUSSED ONLY AT THE LEVEL OF THE INFORMATION MEDIUM .

      " JAPAN : WEEKLY QUESTION TAKENAKA 'S PERSONAL FINANCIAL TRANSACTION WHETHER JAPAN CAN SUCCESSFULLY REFORM IT AILING ECONOMY BY ACCELERATING THE BAILOUT OF THE HUGE AMOUNT OF BAD LOAN HELD BY BANK IS NOW ATTRACTING THE RAPT ATTENTION OF THE WORLD . JAPAN 'S SUCCESS IN SOLVING THIS PROBLEM DEPENDS ON FINANCIAL AFFAIR MINISTER HEIZO TAKENAKA . PRIME MINISTER JUNICHIRO KOIZUMI , WHO HA BEEN CRITICIZED A A LEADER WHO DOE NOT UNDERSTAND THE ECONOMY , APPOINTED MR. TAKANAKA TO TWO MINISTER-LEVEL POST - MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICY AND MINISTER OF FINANCIAL AFFAIR - WHEN HE RESHUFFLED HIS CABINET . THIS INDICATES THAT PRIME MINISTER KOIZUMI HA GIVEN MR. TAKENAKA FULL AUTHORITY OVER THE FORMULATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICY . WHEN MR. TAKENAKA ASSUMED HIS TWO MINISTER-LEVEL POSITION , HE ANNOUNCED THE NAME OF THE BANK AND COMPANY THAT WOULD BE ALLOWED TO GO BANKRUPT . ALSO , HE ORGANIZED A SPECIAL TASK FORCE , SELECTING SCHOLAR , ECONOMIC SPECIALIST AND CONSULTANT WHO HAVE BEEN SEEKING A HARD LANDING AFTER MAKING CHANGE IN JAPAN 'S FINANCIAL SYSTEM . MR. TAKENAKA 'S BOLD POLICY WERE MET WITH STRONG OPPOSITION FROM MEMBER OF THE GOVERNMENT AND EVEN THE RULING PARTY . ALSO , BANKING INDUSTRY EXECUTIVE ATTACKED MR. TAKENAKA 'S POLICY . MR. TAKENAKA HA NOT BEGUN TO IMPLEMENT HIS POLICY YET . THE TOKYO STOCK MARKET HA REACTED NEGATIVELY TO MR. TAKENAKA 'S NEW POLICY A INDICATED BY CONTINUOUS DECLINE IN STOCK PRICE . CRITICISM IS NOT ONLY BEING LEVELED AT MR. TANAKA 'S POLICY BUT ALSO ABOUT HIS PERSONAL REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT A WELL A HIS WAY OF AVOIDING TAX . THE CRITICISM OF HIS PRIVATE FINANCIAL MATTER IS AMPLIFYING THE NATION 'S DOUBT ABOUT HIM . MR. TAKENAKA SEEMS TO BE CREATING MORE ENEMY THAN NECESSARY . THE WEEKLY POST HA FOUND MORE DUBIOUS FINANCIAL TRANSACTION INVOLVING 200 MILLION YEN ( APPROX . $ 1.67 MILLION ) IN LOAN SUSPECTED TO HAVE BEEN MADE BY THE BANK WITH SPECIAL TREATMENT BECAUSE OF MR. TAKENAKA 'S MINISTER POSITION . 1. LUXURIOUS SUMMER HOUSE LAST WEEK ON THIS WEB SITE , THE WEEKLY POST ( TWP ) REPORTED ON DOUBTFUL REAL ESTATE TRANSACTION MADE BY HEIZO TAKENAKA WHO HA TWO POWERFUL FINANCIAL POST - MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICY AND MINISTER OF FINANCIAL AFFAIR - IN THE KOIZUMI ADMINISTRATION . NOW , TWP 'S INVESTIGATION HA FOUND THAT MR. TAKENAKA RECEIVED SPECIAL TREATMENT FROM BANK IN HIS LOAN ARRANGEMENT . OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEAR , THE PUBLIC DOCUMENT PROVIDED BY FINANCIAL AFFAIR MINISTER TAKENAKA ON HIS ASSET INDICATED THAT HE ACQUIRED FOUR PROPERTY . IN 1997 , MR. TAKENAKA PURCHASED A SUMMER HOUSE IN KATSUURA CITY , CHIBA PREFECTURE . THIS LARGE SUMMER HOUSE STAND ON THE TOP OF A HILL WHICH PROVIDES A SPLENDID VIEW OF THE OCEAN . THE HOUSE HA WONDERFUL CONTRAST BETWEEN WHITE WALL AND A RED COLORED ROOF , WHICH MAKE THE HOUSE STAND OUT AMONG IT NEIGHBOR . THE SUMMER HOUSE HA TWO-STORY AND 522 SQUARE METER OF LIVING SPACE . THE LAND WA REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF MR. AND MRS. TAKENAKA , BUT THE HOUSE IS OWNED BY HAYES RESEARCH CENTER INC. , WHICH USED TO BE OWNED BY MR. TAKANAKA . THE BUSINESS OF HAYES RESEARCH CENTER INCLUDE THE MANAGEMENT OF MR. TAKENAKA 'S LECTURE AND RESEARCH WORK REQUESTED BY THE CENTRAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT . IN APRIL OF LAST YEAR WHEN MR. TAKENAKA WA APPOINTED MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICY , OWNERSHIP OF THE COMPANY WA TRANSFERRED TO MRS. TAKENAKA . AT A PRESS CONFERENCE THAT WA HELD A SOON A HE ASSUMED THE MINISTER POSITION , MR. TAKENAKA ANSWERED QUESTION REGARDING THE OWNERSHIP OF HIS SUMMER HOUSE BY HIS COMPANY , `` IT IS NOT ACCURATE TO DESCRIBE THE HOUSE A A SUMMER HOUSE . IT IS A FACILITY TO BE USED FOR SEMINAR THAT HAYES RESEARCH CENTER PROVIDES . HAYES INC. IS A RESEARCH FIRM . THEY ALSO SEND LECTURER TO OUR CLIENT . MOSTLY , IT DEAL WITH ARRANGING MY LECTURE . I AM A UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR AND HAVE BEEN PLANNING TO GET INVOLVED IN THE SEMINAR BUSINESS WITH HAYES INC. THEREFORE , THE HOUSE IS OWNED BY HAYES INC. '' IF THE PROPERTY IS OWNED BY A CORPORATION , LOAN PAYMENT AND MAINTENANCE COST CAN BE EXPENSED . THIS REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF TAX PAID BY MR. TAKENAKA PERSONALLY . THE BANK OF YOKOHAMA FINANCED 40 MILLION YEN ( APPROX . $ 300,000 ) AT 2.925-PERCENT INTEREST FOR MR. TAKENAKA 'S PURCHASE OF THE SUMMER HOUSE . IN SEPTEMBER 1999 , AFTER TWO YEAR OF THIS LOAN ARRANGEMENT , MR. TAKENAKA PAID OFF THE ENTIRE BALANCE THIS LOAN . SINCE THEN , MR. TAKENAKA HA BEEN INVESTING IN OTHER REAL ESTATE PROPERTY . 2. DOWN PAYMENT TOO SMALL IN MARCH OF 1999 , MR. TAKENAKA PURCHASED THREE LUXURY CONDOMINIUM APARTMENT ON THE SAME DAY . THE 54 STOREY BUILDING IS CALLED THE `` OKAWABATA LIBERTY CITY 21 ' AND IS LOCATED IN THE CENTRAL PART OF DOWNTOWN TOKYO . MR. TAKENAKA ACQUIRED A 21ST-FLOOR UNIT FOR 49.9 MILLION YEN ( APPROX . $ 410,000 ) IN CASH UNDER THE NAME OF HAYES RESEARCH CENTER INC. HE PURCHASED A UNIT ON THE 31ST-FLOOR FOR 93 MILLION YEN ( APPROX . $ 775,000 ) . HE BORROWED 34.2 MILLION YEN ( APPROX . $ 285,000 ) FROM HOUSING LOAN CORPORATION AND 35.1 MILLION YEN ( APPROX . $ 292,000 ) FROM ASAHI BANK . THE LOAN AMOUNT FROM THE TWO BANK SUGGEST THAT MR. TAKENAKA MADE A 30-MILLION YEN ( APPROX . $ 250,000 ) DOWN PAYMENT . AFTER ONLY 10 MONTH , MR. TAKENAKA PAID OFF ALL OF THE 70-MILLION YEN OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF HIS LOAN AND LET HAYES RESEARCH CENTER INC. ACQUIRE HIS 31ST-FLOOR UNIT . THE TITLE WA TRANSFERRED TO HAYES . IN THE SAME YEAR , MR. TAKENAKA PAID OFF THE 40-MILLION YEN LOAN BALANCE FOR HIS SUMMER HOUSE A WELL . IN ADDITION , HE PURCHASED ANOTHER CONDOMINIUM UNIT PRICED AT 50 MILLION YEN ( APPROX . $ 417,000 ) IN CASH IN THE SAME YEAR . HIS TOTAL USE OF CASH AMOUNTED TO 160 MILLION YEN ( APPROX . $ 1.33 MILLION ) THAT YEAR . SOON AFTER PAYING 160 MILLION YEN , MR. TAKENAKA PURCHASED A MORE EXPENSIVE CONDOMINIUM IN THE SAME BUILDING WHERE HIS FAMILY CURRENTLY LIFE . THE PRICE OF THE UNIT WA 181 MILLION YEN ( APPROX . $ 1.51 MILLION ) . A 170-MILLION YEN ( APPROX . $ 1.42 MILLION ) MORTGAGE WA ARRANGED WITH ASAHI BANK UNDER THE TITLE OF MR. AND MRS. TAKENAKA . THEIR DOWN PAYMENT WA ONLY 11 MILLION YEN ( APPROX . $ 92,000 ) - ONLY 6.5 PERCENT OF THE ENTIRE MORTGAGE . IN JAPAN , IT IS UNUSUAL FOR ANYONE TO BORROW SUCH A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY WITH SUCH A SMALL DOWN PAYMENT . DID THE BANK GIVE MR. TAKENAKA SPECIAL TREATMENT ? THE MORTGAGE BANK , RISONA HOLDING CO. OWNED BY ASAHI BANK , SAID TO THE WEEKLY POST , `` WE CAN NOT ANSWER ANY QUESTION ABOUT INDIVIDUAL TRANSACTION . '' UNDER A NON DISCLOSURE OF IDENTITY AGREEMENT , ONE LOAN MANAGER AT A MAJOR BANK SAID , `` BANK ARE APPROVING LOAN BASED ON A MANUAL PROVIDED BY THE FINANCIAL SERVICE AGENCY . UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE WOULD A BANK APPROVE A 170-MILLION YEN LOAN FOR A 181-MILLION YEN PROPERTY A WA GRANTED TO MR. TAKENAKA , `` NORMALLY , HOUSING LOAN ARE APPROVED FOR 60 PERCENT OF THE PRICE THAT BUYER PAY FOR PROPERTY . IN MR. TAKENAKA 'S CASE , IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABOUT 100 MILLION YEN . IT SHOULD BE LIMITED TO 144 MILLION , 80 PERCENT OF THE PRICE HE PAID . SO , I ASSUME THAT THE MORTGAGE BANK DID A SPECIAL FAVOR FOR MR. TAKENAKA FOR A SPECIAL REASON . '' THE INSPECTION MANUAL OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICE AGENCY ( FSA ) DEFINES THAT THE BAILOUT AMOUNT OF MORTGAGED REAL ESTATE PROPERTY SHOULD BE LE THAN 70 PERCENT OF THE APPRAISED VALUE . THIS GUIDELINE WA MADE IN ORDER TO SECURE LOAN FROM BANK . IF BANK MAKE LOAN GREATER THAN 70 PERCENT OF THE PROPERTY VALUE , FSA INSPECTOR MAY REQUIRE THEM TO TAKE ADDITIONAL SECURITY FROM THE BORROWER . BANK SHOULD AVOID SUCH MORTGAGE . WHEN ASAHI BANK GAVE THE 170-MILLION YEN MORTGAGE TO MR. TAKENAKA IN APRIL 2000 , HE DID NOT HOLD A MINISTER POSITION . HOWEVER , MR. TAKENAKA HAD ALREADY BEEN A MEMBER OF THE ECONOMIC STRATEGY COMMITTEE ATTACHED TO THEN PRIME MINISTER OBUCHI . HE HAD POLITICAL POWER . IT IS NOT AN UNREASONABLE ASSUMPTION THAT ASAHI BANK DID A SPECIAL FAVOR FOR MR. TAKENAKA BECAUSE OF HIS POSITION . 3. OUTRAGEOUSLY LOW INTEREST RATE SINCE HE WA GIVEN MINISTER POSITION , MR. TAKANAKA HA BEEN RECEIVING SPECIAL TREATMENT FROM BANK . ON JANUARY 18 , MR. TAKENATA PAID BACK IN FULL THE 170-MILLION YEN HOUSING LOAN TO ASAHI BANK AND , ON THE SAME DAY , HE OBTAINED A 50-MILLION YEN ( APPROX . $ 417,000 ) NEW LOAN FROM TOKYO-MITSUBISHI BANK PUTTING UP HIS 47TH-FLOOR CONDOMINIUM APARTMENT A SECURITY . THE MORTGAGE RATE WA SET AT 1.2 PERCENT . AT THAT TIME , THE PREVAILING MORTGAGE RATE OF BANK WERE ABOVE THE TWO-PERCENT LEVEL . MR. TAKENAKA SEEMED TO HAVE REFINANCED HIS MORTGAGE BY MOVING TO TOKYO-MITSUBISHI BANK WHICH GAVE HIM THE LOWER RATE . ALSO , HIS MORTGAGE AMOUNT DECREASED FROM 170 MILLION YEN TO 50 MILLION YEN . EVEN CONSIDERING HIS SALE PROCEEDS FROM ONE CONDOMINIUM WHICH TOOK PLACE TWO MONTH BEFORE , HIS 120-MILLION YEN ( APPROX . $ 1 MILLION ) PAY-OFF OF THE MORTGAGE SHOW HIS HIGH EARNINGS A WELL A A NICE CASH FLOW . HOWEVER , YUKIO SAKURAI , A CRITIC OF HOUSING SAID , `` WHEN BANK GIVE HOUSING LOAN , THEY TAKE COLLATERAL AND INVOLVE LOAN GUARANTEE CORPORATION IN THE MIDDLE TO ESTABLISH DUAL SECURITY FOR THE LOAN . IN THE CASE OF MR. TAKENAKA , TOKYO-MITSUBISHI DID NOT GET A LOAN GUARANTEE CORPORATION INVOLVED . SO , THE LOAN IS CONSIDERED TO BE A REGULAR LOAN , NOT A HOUSING LOAN . IN THIS CASE , THE 1.2 PERCENT RATE APPLIED TO HIS LOAN WA TOO LOW . '' THE AFOREMENTIONED BANKER WHO IS IN CHARGE OF LENDING AT A MAJOR BANK SAID , `` THE LOAN FROM TOKYO-MITSUBISHI BANK TO MR. TAKENAKA IS AN ORDINARY LOAN FOR REAL ESTATE ACQUISITION GIVEN TO SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZE CORPORATION . CURRENTLY , THE RATE OF SUCH LOAN ARE 4 TO 8 PERCENT BECAUSE THE FSA IS GUIDING BANK TO KEEP RATE HIGH FOR LOAN TO BUSINESS CORPORATION , `` EVEN FOR LOAN MADE TO MAJOR CORPORATION , BANK CHARGE 3 PERCENT INTEREST . THE 1.2 PERCENT RATE GRANTED TO MR. TAKENAKA SEEMS TO ONLY BE GIVEN TO GROUP CORPORATION OF THE BANK . '' NORMALLY IN JAPAN , BANK GIVE BETTER RATE TO IT GROUP COMPANY . WHAT THE SOURCE SAID WA THAT TOKYO-MITSUBISHI BANK GAVE A RATE TO MR. TAKENAKA A LOW A IT GIVE TO MITSUBISHI-GROUP CORPORATION . THE PUBLIC COMMUNICATION DEPARTMENT AT TOKYO-MITSUBISHI BANK REPLIED TO QUESTION POSED BY TWP , `` DUE TO REQUIREMENT FOR PRIVACY PROTECTION , WE CAN NOT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION . '' MINISTER OF FINANCIAL AFFAIR TAKENAKA HA ALREADY LAUNCHED POLICY AIMED AT TIGHTENING INSPECTION MADE BY THE FSA ON BANK AND INJECTING PUBLIC MONEY INTO AILING BANK . HE ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD PURSUE MORE SEVERELY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF TOP MANAGEMENT FOR HAVING LED THEIR BANK INTO FINANCIAL PROBLEM BY MISMANAGEMENT . ON OCTOBER 18 , THE FSA ISSUED MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT ORDER TO UFJ BANK WHICH CUT 2.5 TRILLION YEN ( APPROX . $ 20.8 BILLION ) IN LOAN TO SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZE CORPORATION . ALSO , ON THE SAME DAY , THE FSA ISSUED MANAGEMENT ORDER TO ASAHI BANK WHICH STOLE 1.4 TRILLION YEN ( APPROX . $ 11.7 BILLION ) EXISTING LOAN FROM OTHER BANK . IT MAY NOT BE FAIRE TO CRITICIZE MR. TAKENAKA , BUT , HE MAY DESERVE THE CRITICISM THAT , SINCE MR. TAKENAKA PAID OFF ALL MORTGAGE TO ASAHI BANK , HE MIGHT HAVE FELT FREE FOR PUNISHING ASAHI BANK . MR. TAKENAKA IS THE RESPONSIBLE MINISTER OF THE FSA . WHILE JAPAN 'S SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZE CORPORATION ARE SUFFERING FROM THE CREDIT CRUNCH OF BANK FOR LOAN AND BANK ' RAISING INTEREST RATE FOR THEM , ONLY MR. TAKENAKA IS RECEIVING SWEET DEAL . THE TWP CONTACTED MR. TAKENAKA AND RAISED THE QUESTION . HE REPLIED , `` I WILL NOT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION . '' THAT WA HIS ONLY ANSWER . SHUKAN POSUTO [ THE WEEKLY POST ] ( INTERNET VERSION-WWW )\n",

      " PRODI , BANK ENGAGE IN MORTGAGE ROW ( ANSA ) -- ROME , APRIL 22 -- A ROW ON HIGH MORTGAGE RATE RUMBLED ON TODAY A CONSUMER THREATENED LEGAL ACTION AND A LEADING ITALIAN MORTGAGE INSTITUTE ACCUSED A BRITISH BANK OF UNFAIR COMPETITION . THE ROW WA SPARKED YESTERDAY BY A SHARP EXCHANGE BETWEEN ITALIAN PREMIER ROMANO PRODI AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE ITALIAN BANKING ASSOCIATION , TANCREDI BIANCHI . PRODI HAILED TUESDAY 'S [ 21 APRIL ] NIGHT CUT IN THE BANK OF ITALY 'S DISCOUNT RATE A PAVING THE WAY FOR 5 % MORTGAGE , A `` CHERISHED GOAL '' OF HIS ECONOMIC POLICY . BIANCHI REPLIED THAT BANK HAD NO INTENTION OF CUTTING MORTGAGE RATE SO LOW , WITHOUT SOME FORM OF GOVERNMENT SUBSIDY . COMMENTATOR IN TODAY 'S PRESS TENDED TO SIDE WITH PRODI AGAINST THE BIG BANK WHICH ARE SWIFT TO RAISE RATE BUT SLOW TO CUT THEM . A CORRIERE DELLA SERUM LEADER ACCUSED THE BANK OF PENALISING HOME-OWNERS AT THE EXPENSE OF BIGGER CLIENT TO WHOM THEY OFFER SEEMINGLY UNLIMITED CREDIT . TODAY , A TOP OFFICIAL AT A LEADING MORTGAGE AND INVESTMENT INSTITUTE , FONSPA , RENATO CASSARO , ACCUSED UK BANK ABBEY NATIONAL OF `` UNFAIR COMPETITION '' IN OFFERING MORTGAGE RATE THAT ARE EVEN LOWER THAN THE 5 % CITED BY PRODI . CASSARO CLAIMED THAT ABBEY 'S RATE WOULD TURN OUT TO BE `` EXACTLY THE SAME A OUR OWN 6.5 % '' IF THE PROPER CALCULATION WERE MADE . HE SAID ABBEY WA `` MISLEADING CUSTOMER , '' AN ALLEGED CRIME THAT WA ALL THE MORE SERIOUS , HE CLAIMED , `` ON THE PART OF A COUNTRY THAT IT IS N'T EVEN IN EMU [ ECONOMIC AND MONETARY UNION ] . '' ABBEY RECENTLY BEGAN TRADING IN ITALY , SPEARHEADING WHAT THE PRESS HA BILLED A `` A FOREIGN INVASION '' . CASSARO ALSO ADVANCED A PROPOSAL FOR SOLVING THE MORTGAGE PROBLEM : SCRAPPING ALL PRE-EXISTING CONTRACT AND RE-NEGOTIATING THEM . THAT WAY , HE SAID , LOW-RATE CREDIT FOR COMPANY AND OTHER BIG CUSTOMER COULD BE RAISED AND HIGH-RATE CREDIT TO HOME- OWNER COULD BE LOWERED . THE ITALIAN BANKING ASSOCIATION MEANWHILE ANNOUNCED IT WA KEEPING TO A PRESS BLACK-OUT AFTER YESTERDAY 'S FLAP . IT DENIED ASKING THE GOVERNMENT FOR MONEY TO HELP IT MEMBER LOWER MORTGAGE RATE . PREMIER PRODI COMMENTED WRYLY : `` WELL , I SEE THEY 'VE DONE EVERYTHING BY THEMSELVES ... FIRST THEY ASKED FOR ( SUBSIDY ) , THEN THEY TOOK THEM BACK . '' A CONSUMER ' ASSOCIATION , ADICONSUM , REPEATED A THREAT TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST BANK WHICH HAVE NOT LOWERED MORTGAGE RATE DESPITE A SUCCESSION OF CUT IN THE BANK OF ITALY 'S DISCOUNT RATE . TREASURY MINISTER CARLO AZEGLIO CIAMPI SAID THE STATE COULD N'T STEP IN BETWEEN BANK AND CUSTOMER TO GET FAIRER MORTGAGE . SPEAKING IN THE SENATE , HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE ISSUE WA `` DELICATE '' BUT STRESSED : `` MORTGAGE ARE CONTRACT BETWEEN AUTONOMOUS AND INDEPENDENT SUBJECT AND I DO NOT SEE WHY THERE SHOULD BE INTERVENTION ON THE PART OF THE STATE . '' CIAMPI SAID HE HAD RECEIVED NO REQUEST FROM ABI . HE DID NOT COMMENT ON PASSARO 'S IDEA OF USING TAX CREDIT A AN INCENTIVE FOR REWRITING MORTGAGE TERM . OPPOSITION ECONOMIC SPOKESMAN ANTONIO MARZANO SAID MORTGAGE- HOLDER SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO RENEGOTIATE THEIR TERM WHEN THE BORROWING ENVIRONMENT CHANGED , WITHOUT THE STIFF PENALTY AT PRESENT ENVISAGED . `` IT IS CLEAR THAT THE BARGAINING POWER IN DRAFTING MORTGAGE IS ALWAYS TILTED TOWARDS THE BANK , BUT THEY MUST USE IT IN A REASONABLE WAY , '' HE SAID . MARZANO CLAIMED THAT PREMIER PRODI HAD BEEN GUILTY OF A SOPHOMORIC MISTAKE IN ASSUMING THAT THE BANK OF ITALY DISCOUNT RATE SHOULD BE THE SAME A THE RATE APPLIED BY BANK TO LOAN AND MORTGAGE . HE ALSO POINTED OUT THAT THE EUROPEAN MONETARY INSTITUTE , FORERUNNER OF THE FUTURE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK , `` ENVISAGES INTEREST RATE AT 6 % TO SUPPORT THE EURO . '' `` THIS WISHFUL THINKING BASED ON NOTHING AMOUNT TO PURE DEMAGOGUERY , '' MARZANO CLAIMED . ABBEY NATIONAL ISSUED A STATEMENT REPLYING TO CASSARO 'S ALLEGATION AND TO SIMILAR CLAIM BY TANCREDI BIANCHI , CARRIED IN THE PRESS THIS MORNING . ABBEY NATIONAL CONFIRMED THAT IT MORTGAGE RATE ARE BETWEEN 4 AND 5 % AND `` DO NOT CONCEAL ANY COMMISSION COST . '' IT ALSO NOTED THAT `` WE DID NOT ASK FOR ANY STATE SUBSIDY IN ORDER TO APPLY THESE RATE . '' ABBEY DESCRIBED TANCREDI 'S CLAIM A `` FALSE AND OFFENSIVE . '' IT ALSO POINTED OUT THAT IT MAY BE A FOREIGN BANK BUT IT IS ALSO A EUROPEAN UNION BANK OPERATING UNDER THE SAME CONDITION A ITALIAN BANK ABROAD . IT THEREFORE CALLED ON TANCREDI BIANCHI TO `` SWIFTLY RECTIFY HIS STATEMENT . '' IN TODAY 'S ITALIAN NEWSPAPER THE ABI CHIEF WA QUOTED A CLAIMING THAT ABBEY 'S 4 % RATE DID NOT INCLUDE COMMISSION COST . ALSO THIS EVENING , ANOTHER BRITISH BANK , THE WOOLWICH , ANNOUNCED A NEW MORTGAGE TO BE LAUNCHED IN MAY AT 4.5 % . IT WILL BE INDEX-LINKED TO THE SWISS FRANC AND WILL HAVE A MAXIMUM LENGTH OF 15 YEAR , THE WOOLWICH SAID .\n",

in the country  that starting today it can not fly any of the nine dc9 jet that make up it fleet  the jet will remain grounded for at least two week while aerorepublica supply civil aeronautics with the paperwork and document containing record of the jet engine bought from the alitalia company about four year ago  according to civil aeronautics director abel enrique jimenez neira  the colombian airline did not achieve the aviation  certification  already granted to avianca  ace  and tampa   a long a aerorepublica is unable to meet the standard  it must wait and will be barred from flying because of concern for safety  they did not pas inspection   jimenez neira said  the official noted that the key issue that prompted the drastic measure is the fact that aerorepublica ha no record for most of it jet  for now  the airline ha the possibility of flying again with three of it nine jet  it all depends on the result of the inspection that civil aeronautics inspector are planning to make in the next four day of the three jet that have not been checked  if aerorepublica is able to supply all of it document in order  the three dc9 jet will be allowed to fly  otherwise  they will remain grounded like the rest of the jet until the standard are met  the civil aeronautics director stated that the airline can also choose to bring other plane into the country  leased  a long a they conform to international aviation safety standard  jimenez stated that the suspension of operation doe not mean that problem or mechanical failure were detected on aerorepublica jet  but that the deadline ran out yesterday for the airline to comply with all safety standard in order for it to be certified  a is known  certification wa a measure or an inspection that civil aeronautics started implementing last year at the recommendation of the us federal aviation administration  faa   in compliance with the standard set forth by the international civil aviation organization  icao   the world s top organization governing the airline industry  the certification process consisted of a civil aeronautics inspection of operation manual  pilot qualification  maintenance file  and the aviation practice used in order to determine if the airline were adhering to international standard  precisely because it did not fulfill the duty of monitoring these check and balance with respect to colombian airline  the faa decided in october 1995 to lower civil aeronautics s rating from category one to category two  after determining that civil aeronautics wa not performing it duty of monitoring operation and that colombian aviation wa not safe enough  last year  civil aeronautics certified the three colombian airline that have regularly scheduled flight to the united state  avianca  ace  and tampa  it began the same certification process this year with domestic carrier  and aerorepublica wa the first to be selected  after setting a deadline for the airline to submit all

the belgian pilot  association bca ha serious safety concern about european air transport  eat   the belgian airline which transport package for dhl  operating out of zaventem airport  the bca is voicing it fear in the wake of a whole series of complaint from member of staff at eat  the maintenance of the aircraft is  below standard  and the maximum number of hour flown by pilot is not being respected  the bca claim  what is more  eat is primarily resorting to the service of foreign pilot who pay no tax or social security contribution here  more than half of eat s pilot have foreign identity card  most of them are individual who find their way to belgium via british temporary employment agency specialized in air transport  according to the pilot  association  the payment of social security contribution and tax are being avoided  because if they are being paid anywhere  it is certainly not in belgium  for example  portuguese pilot have address in the united kingdom where they never stay  the pilot  association went to the public prosecutor s office with it finding 18 month ago  the investigation being conducted by the labor inspectorate led to a whole series of protocol and the establishment of infringement  but so far no case have found their way to court  incidentally  eat is by far from the only airline employing large number of foreigner  virgin also doe so  for example  however  it is not just here that the shoe pinch  various source have confirmed to u that these foreigner do virtually everything demanded of them by eat  bearing in mind their weak social position  one eat pilot came to the staggering conclusion that some canadian had worked 28 night in succession  which violates all the rule  they do this so that they can subsequently enjoy a few week  break in canada  admittedly eat ha been granted permission by the belgian civil aviation authority to allow it personnel to work a bit longer than the normal rule of eight day  flying  six day  rest  but the authority attached a whole series of condition to this and definitely doe not permit 28 day of uninterrupted service  for example  the pilot in question may not fly by day  yet more than 100 pilot working for the company confirmed in a petition that they are having to do this  one belgian pilot on eat s book wa deeply concerned at these duty time and after complaining to no effect submitted a dossier crammed full of detail of violation to the authority  only to be dismissed one week later for taking this initiative  apparently the management s attention had been drawn to his dossier  officially  the french letter of dismissal described him  in french  a  no longer meeting our requirement   this wa emphatically denied by other pilot   he wa one of our best flight officer   they said   a highly professional pilot  always concerned about safety matter  his concern about the duty time prof this  he only took step after having flown on several occasion with copilot who were overtired   the pilot  association ha also received a whole stack of complaint about substandard maintenance and flight safety at eat  for example  some technician have admitted that they receive bonus depending on how much money is not spent during maintenance  some pilot have reported that they were forced to fly their machine to zaventem even after a technical fault had been detected  even when the aircraft did not meet the required minimum equipment list  meanwhile  in the technical report  called trouble report   some defect are listed for several successive day  with a technician writing in each case that the problem ha been resolved  pilot confirm that the mandatory daily inspection by a technician is often limited to signing the log book  this is referred to a  a daily eat   eat  by the way  ha 20 aircraft of it own and charter around 40 more  plus crew member  from other airline  including u company  while these aircraft operate out of belgium  they do not fall under the strict belgian legislation and are therefore virtually impossible to monitor  agalev  flemish ecology party  deputy lode van oost  who ha put question to transport minister michel daerden on several occasion with regard to eat  is regularly told that the authority ha not detected any violation   i ask myself how that can possibly be the case   van oost said  however  after yet another question along similar line wa asked last week  the authority ha supposedly now launched an investigation after all  which  according to our source  ha uncovered all kind of irregularity  the pilot  association also recently went to the authority to talk about the problem at eat   we have nothing whatsoever against the company  but we are of the opinion that it must act in accordance with the rule   the association s president  jean de looze  said  when asked for his reaction yesterday evening  29 june   eat s director of operation  iwein van caelenberg said that he knew there were problem with the duty time and that these are currently under review   so we are working on it   he pointed out that eat ha no option but to take foreign pilot into service because there is a shortage of pilot in belgium  according to van caelenberg  the legislation here is not at all suitable for dealing with this  irreversible situation   he admits that the pilot signed a petition en masse   but the question were put so suggestively that they could not help but sign it    just like other airline  safety is the single top priority at eat and maintenance is carried out by the book   van caelenberg added   there is no airline which get thing right all the time and where there are no complainer  ', ' state council approves plan for forming police force to ensure airline safety beijing

friedrich wilhelm graefe zu baringdorf  president of the agriculture and rural development commission of the european parliament  graefe zu baringdorf said bluntly what many people in europe are

fact that bse and hoof and mouth disease have hit this country with full force   the united kingdom ha in a way been chosen by destiny to show to all of europe how you should not run agriculture   he

in france  according to the president of the european parliament s agriculture commission   the renationalization of agricultural policy  would not change anything  because trade is a necessity  since the european country are unable to aspire to selfsufficiency in food  in addition   renationalization would not an adapted response  the vigilance of the public authority must exist inside each state

chirac gave a reminder that the reform of the cap  is not on the agenda   the president ha not forgotten that it wa himself  who wa behind the productivist and promarket choice of european agriculture  when he wa the agriculture minister under president pompidou  quite obviously  only a francogerman initiative could get a reform moving  stressed graefe zu baringdorf  health control although

influenced by economic consideration   according to graefe zu baringdorf  it is necessary to institute control in importing country  which will be orientated more toward the health of consumer

new agriculture minister promptly called for a radial change of course   quality rather than mass production   wa the watchword reaffirmed this weekend by the german green  congress in stuttgart  this turnabout  which is causing anxiety within the profession  especially in france  nevertheless reflects the realization in germany both that farming is not just a matter for farmer and also that  even within our urban society  it extends to more a more complex range of factor  france s socialist government  which ha worked since it accession to power to promote agriculture more respectful of it environment  by offering farmer new land use contract  is ready to take the german at their word  it wa easy for french agriculture minister to point out  in an interview published by le echo 8 march

the phenomenon is far from having been brought under control in the uk  the authority are pursuing it intensively  with so many new outbreak daily there  that is  on our doorstep  there is a great risk  the wind or the thousand of tourist and truck crossing the channel every day could bring the virus in   le figaro  but ha the battle been won a regard the risk of direct contamination by sheep imported from the uk between 1 and 21 february   glavany  let u say that it is on the way to being so  this is why i have asked europe to lighten the restrictive measure that it imposed on u a soon a possible  on the basis of the provision that france ha adopted  a a precaution  we have slaughtered 40000 british sheep or sheep that were in contact with british sheep  and we have introduced safety boundary  france ha decided to hit hard and fast  and we are now seeing that this is what had to be done  i would feel more reassured if our neighbor had done thee same   le figaro  what do you mean   glavany  i am not sure that everyone ha monitored british import a we have  one of the lesson of this crisis is  in passing  that europe must make progress with regard to traceability of sheep  the british say that we are not the only one to whom they supplied sheep during the critical period  i am not talking about protective or preventive slaughter measure elsewhere  expect in the netherlands   le figaro  are you saying this because europe ha not been kind to france   glavany  the european institution have functioned well  it is  rather  outside the eu that there ha been a hastiness to do more than necessary and to confuse mercenary consideration with the precaution principle  but  compared to our neighbor  it is true that it is better not to go down on your knee  it being the foremost agricultural and animal farming power  france will evidently not be excused any weakness   le figaro  francois daubert  deputy for mayenne  want to appeal to the european court of justice  since he considers the embargo on orne and mayenne illegal  what is your opinion   glavany  i do not encourage francois daubert to attack the european decision  europe can not be criticized for doing it job  some country wanted to have u subjected to a blockade affecting the whole of our territory  we succeeded in confining it to these two department  which served a our health shield  in view of the sacrifice that is being demanded of them  they must enjoy the nation s support   le figaro  despite all the measure adopted to limit the spread of the illness  french people remain skeptical  and the consumption of lamb ha fallen by almost 30 percent during the past month   glavany  this is critical  particularly since this illness is not dangerous to human being  the message that we are driving home  health minister bernard kouchner and i  is clear  however  this is indeed an animal health problem  not a public health problem  there is no reason for this drop in consumption  but it is true that the succession of crisis  bse and then hoof and mouth disease  is causing reflex response among the public  the picture of slaughter house and pyre shown on television over the past month have played a frightening role and explain this rejection  we really must abandon this disastrous psychosis a soon a possible  because it is having a domino effect  i have even been told that reservation at rural holiday camp in mayenne have been canceled   le figaro  the main victim are the farmer  do you understand their distress   glavany  of course any sector of society that were to experience what they are experiencing would ask question about their purpose and their future  they are at the end of their tether  but who would not be so  this is why they must be given not only financial  but also moral support  they are suffering the effect of two crisis  consumption ha fallen by 50 percent and export by 980 percent  in the case of hood and mouth disease  we must be brave enough to resolutely pursue the measure that we have adopted  this will make it possible to lift them a soon a possible  in the case of bse  we must accelerate and increase economic support to the sector  i am worried to see that very few country in europe are implementing the program for the purchase and destruction of cattle over 30 month old decided on 2 january  we have considerable surplus  hundred of thousand of head of cattle need to be slaughtered in europe  including young heifer  in order to restore a balance between supply and demand  the country of the north oppose this  but if we not do it  we will cause this crisis to drag on for month and month   le figaro  we are clinging to the rationale of an agricultural economy on a drip  should cap  common agricultural policy  not be called into question   glavany  i admit that the industry s economic dependency is hard to accept  both for the public and for farmer themselves  but i do not want to envisage a nonsubsidized european policy  because that would reduce the number of farmer from 680000 to 150000  with all the repercussion that this would have on land management and the balance of society  however  i do think that subsidy are badly allocated and that cap must be reoriented  but this is a separate debate  and it is not topical at a time of crisis ', ' lending rate rise a mortgage price war  end the two biggest mortgage

earthquake  for another year  it is estimated that this will cost the government nt  650 million  u  1857 million  ', ' japan  weekly question takenaka s personal financial transaction whether japan can successfully reform it ailing economy by accelerating the bailout of the huge amount of bad loan held by bank is now attracting the rapt attention of the world  japan s success in solving this problem depends on financial affair minister heizo takenaka  prime minister junichiro koizumi  who ha been criticized a a leader who doe not understand the economy  appointed mr takanaka to two ministerlevel post  minister of economic and financial policy and minister of financial affair  when he reshuffled his cabinet  this indicates that prime minister koizumi ha given mr takenaka full authority over the formulation and implementation of economic and financial policy  when mr takenaka assumed his two ministerlevel position  he announced the name of the bank and company that would be allowed to go bankrupt  also  he organized a special task force  selecting scholar  economic specialist and consultant who have been seeking a hard landing after making change in japan s financial system  mr takenaka s bold policy were met with strong opposition from member of the government and even the ruling party  also  banking industry executive attacked mr takenaka s policy  mr takenaka ha not begun to implement his policy yet  the tokyo stock market ha reacted negatively to mr takenaka s new policy a indicated by continuous decline in stock price  criticism is not only being leveled at mr tanaka s policy but also about his personal real estate investment a well a his way of avoiding tax  the criticism of his private financial matter is amplifying the nation s doubt about him  mr takenaka seems to be creating more enemy than necessary  the weekly post ha found more dubious financial transaction involving 200 million yen  approx   167 million  in loan suspected to have been made by the bank with special treatment because of mr takenaka s minister position  1 luxurious summer house last week on this web site  the weekly post  twp  reported on doubtful real estate transaction made by heizo takenaka who ha two powerful financial post  minister of economic and financial policy and minister of financial affair  in the koizumi administration  now  twp s investigation ha found that mr takenaka received special treatment from bank in his loan arrangement  over the last several year  the public document provided by financial affair minister takenaka on his asset indicated that he acquired four property  in 1997  mr takenaka purchased a summer house in katsuura city  chiba prefecture  this large summer house stand on the top of a hill which provides a splendid view of the ocean  the house ha wonderful contrast between white wall and a red colored roof  which make the house stand out among it neighbor  the summer house ha twostory and 522 square meter of living space  the land wa registered in the name of mr and mrs takenaka  but the house is owned by hayes research center inc  which used to be owned by mr takanaka  the business of hayes research center include the management of mr takenaka s lecture and research work requested by the central and local government  in april of last year when mr takenaka wa appointed minister of economic and financial policy  ownership of the company wa transferred to mrs takenaka  at a press conference that wa held a soon a he assumed the minister position  mr takenaka answered question regarding the ownership of his summer house by his company   it is not accurate to describe the house a a summer house  it is a facility to be used for seminar that hayes research center provides  hayes inc is a research firm  they also send lecturer to our client  mostly  it deal with arranging my lecture  i am a university professor and have been planning to get involved in the seminar business with hayes inc therefore  the house is owned by hayes inc  if the property is owned by a corporation  loan payment and maintenance cost can be expensed  this reduces the amount of tax paid by mr takenaka personally  the bank of yokohama financed 40 million yen  approx   300000  at 2925percent interest for mr takenaka s purchase of the summer house  in september 1999  after two year of this loan arrangement  mr takenaka paid off the entire balance this loan  since then  mr takenaka ha been investing in other real estate property  2 down payment too small in march of 1999  mr takenaka purchased three luxury condominium apartment on the same day  the 54 storey building is called the  okawabata liberty city 21  and is located in the central part of downtown tokyo  mr takenaka acquired a 21stfloor unit for 499 million yen  approx   410000  in cash under the name of hayes research center inc he purchased a unit on the 31stfloor for 93 million yen  approx   775000   he borrowed 342 million yen  approx   285000  from housing loan corporation and 351 million yen  approx   292000  from asahi bank  the loan amount from the two bank suggest that mr takenaka made a 30million yen  approx   250000  down payment  after only 10 month  mr takenaka paid off all of the 70million yen outstanding balance of his loan and let hayes research center inc acquire his 31stfloor unit  the title wa transferred to hayes  in the same year  mr takenaka paid off the 40million yen loan balance for his summer house a well  in addition  he purchased another condominium unit priced at 50 million yen  approx   417000  in cash in the same year  his total use of cash amounted to 160 million yen  approx   133 million  that year  soon after paying 160 million yen  mr takenaka purchased a more expensive condominium in the same building where his family currently life  the price of the unit wa 181 million yen  approx   151 million   a 170million yen  approx   142 million  mortgage wa arranged with asahi bank under the title of mr and mrs takenaka  their down payment wa only 11 million yen  approx   92000   only 65 percent of the entire mortgage  in japan  it is unusual for anyone to borrow such a large amount of money with such a small down payment  did the bank give mr takenaka special treatment  the mortgage bank  risona holding co owned by asahi bank  said to the weekly post   we can not answer any question about individual transaction   under a non disclosure of identity agreement  one loan manager at a major bank said   bank are approving loan based on a manual provided by the financial service agency  under no circumstance would a bank approve a 170million yen loan for a 181million yen property a wa granted to mr takenaka   normally  housing loan are approved for 60 percent of the price that buyer pay for property  in mr takenaka s case  it should have been about 100 million yen  it should be limited to 144 million  80 percent of the price he paid  so  i assume that the mortgage bank did a special favor for mr takenaka for a special reason   the inspection manual of the financial service agency  fsa  defines that the bailout amount of mortgaged real estate property should be le than 70 percent of the appraised value  this guideline wa made in order to secure loan from bank  if bank make loan greater than 70 percent of the property value  fsa inspector may require them to take additional security from the borrower  bank should avoid such mortgage  when asahi bank gave the 170million yen mortgage to mr takenaka in april 2000  he did not hold a minister position  however  mr takenaka had already been a member of the economic strategy committee attached to then prime minister obuchi  he had political power  it is not an unreasonable assumption that asahi bank did a special favor for mr takenaka because of his position  3 outrageously low interest rate since he wa given minister position  mr takanaka ha been receiving special treatment from bank  on january 18  mr takenata paid back in full the 170million yen housing loan to asahi bank and  on the same day  he obtained a 50million yen  approx   417000  new loan from tokyomitsubishi bank putting up his 47thfloor condominium apartment a security  the mortgage rate wa set at 12 percent  at that time  the prevailing mortgage rate of bank were above the twopercent level  mr takenaka seemed to have refinanced his mortgage by moving to tokyomitsubishi bank which gave him the lower rate  also  his mortgage amount decreased from 170 million yen to 50 million yen  even considering his sale proceeds from one condominium which took place two month before  his 120million yen  approx   1 million  payoff of the mortgage show his high earnings a well a a nice cash flow  however  yukio sakurai  a critic of housing said   when bank give housing loan  they take collateral and involve loan guarantee corporation in the middle to establish dual security for the loan  in the case of mr takenaka  tokyomitsubishi did not get a loan guarantee corporation involved  so  the loan is considered to be a regular loan  not a housing loan  in this case  the 12 percent rate applied to his loan wa too low   the aforementioned banker who is in charge of lending at a major bank said   the loan from tokyomitsubishi bank to mr takenaka is an ordinary loan for real estate acquisition given to small and mediumsize corporation  currently  the rate of such loan are 4 to 8 percent because the fsa is guiding bank to keep rate high for loan to business corporation   even for loan made to major corporation  bank charge 3 percent interest  the 12 percent rate granted to mr takenaka seems to only be given to group corporation of the bank   normally in japan  bank give better rate to it group company  what the source said wa that tokyomitsubishi bank gave a rate to mr takenaka a low a it give to mitsubishigroup corporation  the public communication department at tokyomitsubishi bank replied to question posed by twp   due to requirement for privacy protection  we can not answer your question   minister of financial affair takenaka ha already launched policy aimed at tightening inspection made by the fsa on bank and injecting public money into ailing bank  he also announced that he would pursue more severely the responsibility of top management for having led their bank into financial problem by mismanagement  on october 18  the fsa issued management improvement order to ufj bank which cut 25 trillion yen  approx   208 billion  in loan to small and mediumsize corporation  also  on the same day  the fsa issued management order to asahi bank which stole 14 trillion yen  approx   117 billion  existing loan from other bank  it may not be faire to criticize mr takenaka  but  he may deserve the criticism that  since mr takenaka paid off all mortgage to asahi bank  he might have felt free for punishing asahi bank  mr takenaka is the responsible minister of the fsa  while japan s small and mediumsize corporation are suffering from the credit crunch of bank for loan and bank  raising interest rate for them  only mr takenaka is receiving sweet deal  the twp contacted mr takenaka and raised the question  he replied   i will not answer your question   that wa his only answer  shukan posuto  the weekly post   internet versionwww ', ' government to limit increase in mortgage rate tokyo  march 18 kyodo  the construction and finance ministry have agreed to limit increase in governmentsponsored mortgage rate in order to maintain brisk home building activity  source at the ministry said  the benchmark lending rate of the governmentaffiliated housing loan corp will be lifted to 24 percent per annum from 22 percent now  the source

month  the boj scrapped the 18monthold policy of guiding the key unsecured overnight call money rate to near zero  setting the new target at around 025  ', ' prodi  bank engage in mortgage row  ansa   rome  april 22  a row on high mortgage rate rumbled on today a consumer threatened legal action and a leading italian mortgage institute accused a british bank of unfair competition  the row wa sparked yesterday by a sharp exchange between italian premier romano prodi and the president of the italian banking association  tancredi bianchi  prodi hailed tuesday s  21 april  night cut in the bank of italy s discount rate a paving the way for 5  mortgage  a  cherished goal  of his economic policy  bianchi replied that bank had no intention of cutting mortgage rate so low  without some form of government subsidy  commentator in today s press tended to side with prodi against the big bank which are swift to raise rate but slow to cut them  a corriere della serum leader accused the bank of penalising homeowners at the expense of bigger client to whom they offer seemingly unlimited credit  today  a top official at a leading mortgage and investment institute  fonspa  renato cassaro  accused uk bank abbey national of  unfair competition  in offering mortgage rate that are even lower than the 5  cited by prodi  cassaro claimed that abbey s rate would turn out to be  exactly the same a our own 65   if the proper calculation were made  he said abbey wa  misleading customer   an alleged crime that wa all the more serious  he claimed   on the part of a country that it is nt even in emu  economic and monetary union    abbey recently began trading in italy  spearheading what the press ha billed a  a foreign invasion   cassaro also advanced a proposal for solving the mortgage problem  scrapping all preexisting contract and renegotiating them  that way  he said  lowrate credit for company and other big customer could be raised and highrate credit to home owner could be lowered  the italian banking association meanwhile announced it wa keeping to a press blackout after yesterday s flap  it denied asking the government for money to help it member lower mortgage rate  premier prodi commented wryly   well  i see they ve done everything by themselves  first they asked for  subsidy   then they took them back   a consumer  association  adiconsum  repeated a threat to take legal action against bank which have not lowered mortgage rate despite a succession of cut in the bank of italy s discount rate  treasury minister carlo azeglio ciampi said the state could nt step in between bank and customer to get fairer mortgage  speaking in the senate  he acknowledged that the issue wa  delicate  but stressed   mortgage are contract between autonomous and independent subject and i do not see why there should be intervention on the part of the state   ciampi said he had received no request from abi  he did not comment on passaro s idea of using tax credit a an incentive for rewriting mortgage term  opposition economic spokesman antonio marzano said mortgage holder should be allowed to renegotiate their term when the borrowing environment changed  without the stiff penalty at present envisaged   it is clear that the bargaining power in drafting mortgage is always tilted towards the bank  but they must use it in a reasonable way   he said  marzano claimed that premier prodi had been guilty of a sophomoric mistake in assuming that the bank of italy discount rate should be the same a the rate applied by bank to loan and mortgage  he also pointed out that the european monetary institute  forerunner of the future european central bank   envisages interest rate at 6  to support the euro    this wishful thinking based on nothing amount to pure demagoguery   marzano claimed  abbey national issued a statement replying to cassaro s allegation and to similar claim by tancredi bianchi  carried in the press this morning  abbey national confirmed that it mortgage rate are between 4 and 5  and  do not conceal any commission cost   it also noted that  we did not ask for any state subsidy in order to apply these rate   abbey described tancredi s claim a  false and offensive   it also pointed out that it may be a foreign bank but it is also a european union bank operating under the same condition a italian bank abroad  it therefore called on tancredi bianchi to  swiftly rectify his statement   in today s italian newspaper the abi chief wa quoted a claiming that abbey s 4  rate did not include commission cost  also this evening  another british bank  the woolwich  announced a new mortgage to be launched in may at 45   it will be indexlinked to the swiss franc and will have a maximum length of 15 year  the woolwich said ']\n"
